@0 = ~Are you awake? Hey! You thought you wouldn't see me any time soon, right? I would have been here so much sooner if Amn had better roads. Way too many puddles and far too few mice-less inns! Anyway, I'm here! Did you miss me?~ [L#2SD001]
@1 = ~Skie?! What? How...? How is that even possible? I thought you were resting at your dad's mansion?~
@2 = ~Oh my... It's you. You know, when I saved you, it wasn't because I wanted to be stalked or something. Have you been watching me sleep?~
@3 = ~Well, I rested a bit, but... I got so bored at home. So I thought: "Hey, you helped to stop the crusade, Skie, so why won't you check up on Amn now and perhaps find <CHARNAME> and say thank you."~
@4 = ~What?! No! Of course not! I just got here. Maybe not just NOW. I had to refresh myself a bit, but... now I'm here. Talking to you. It's just like old times!~
@5 = ~So? What do we do now?~
@6 = ~Let's start with not making me feel so damn lost. Slow down a bit, and tell me, kitty, what in the Nine Hells are you doing so far away from home?~
@7 = ~Wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you talking about? I think I need to hear the whole story. Did someone tell you to find me? And do people from Baldur's Gate know that you left?~
@8 = ~First of all, start by being less annoying and intrusive, Skie. Did I say I want to have anything to do with you?~
@9 = ~Hehe. You have a saucy tongue, don't you? I like it. As for your question: I just wanted to find you.~ [L#2SD011]
@10 = ~No one told me to do it. And... well, they probably noticed that I'm gone. But, hey, it's my life, isn' it? I know, I kinda died, but I don't want to stay in bed for the rest of my life because of that, you know.~ [L#2SD037]
@11 = ~I guess I had it coming, didn't I? I know, I was a bit of a pain back there, in Baldur's Gate and on our way to Dragonspear, but... I'm sorry, okay? Let's just start over.~ [L#2SD026]
@12 = ~I suppose we won't get far before you hear the whole story, right? So, I woke up. Everything was just so dark, so I started to scream. Then, some handsome soldiers found me in my family crypt, and they took me home to Daddy. Do you know how creepy it is to wake up in a crypt? Next to your long-gone aunt? She was scary when alive, and when dead... she's so much scarier.~
@13 = ~Anyway, they called for clerics. I was a bit tired and I still felt weird, so... well, I just don't remember much from that time. It took me three days before I could gather my thoughts, eat something normal, or take a walk.~
@14 = ~But I remembered you. You saved me, right? I remember this blade and... Uhm... were we inside it? Was that nightmarish place inside the dagger?~
@15 = ~Yes. I got there with the help of a mage. Nem.~
@16 = ~I think so. It was like... a demi-plane inside the dagger's gemstone.~
@17 = ~You really know how to deal with all kinds of strange problems.~
@18 = ~Demi-what? Never mind. The thing is, you saved me.~
@19 = ~I wanted to thank you. I know about you... And about that other person... The one who took my place...~
@20 = ~You know how it feels when you wake up, and you know you had this freaky dream and try to remember what it was about... it's hard, right? It was exactly the same, but then I remembered.~
@21 = ~We traveled together, Skie. I wouldn't leave you inside the Soultaker.~
@22 = ~I did that to clear my name, Skie. That was my main goal.~
@23 = ~I knew it. You are just like me. And... thank you. You saved me.~ [L#2SD024]
@24 = ~You... you did that only because of your reputation? I mean... it's important, too... I just thought you cared about more than just yourself. This makes you sound kinda like Eldoth...~
@25 = ~But it doesn't change the fact that you saved me, does it? And that's why I should thank you. So... thanks. Really.~
@26 = ~So, that's all. I think. I wanted to tell you all of that and just see if you're all right. You sometimes get yourself involved in some nasty stuff! But before I leave...~
@27 = ~You probably know that I would be REALLY happy to join you. But I know you have things to do. Still, if you decide that you need me, maybe let's just meet in Waukeen's Promenade, okay? There are so many shops there. I'll take a look at what they've got, and you'll get some time to make up your mind.~
@28 = ~Bye! Talk to you soon!~
@29 = ~Oh, it's you! I hoped you'd find me here. The Promenade is AMAZING. So much better than the marketplace in Baldur's Gate! Anyway, are you here to ask me to join you? That would be great.~
@30 = ~No. Sorry. I was just checking if you're fine. Now I've got something to do, so...~
@31 = ~Well, yes, actually. I think I could use your help, Skie. If you still want to join, that is.~
@32 = ~You've got important things to do, I'm sure. Go on, I'll be fine. Probably.~ [L#2SD044]
@33 = ~Oh, of course, I want to join! I'm so excited! So? What now? Shopping or walking?~
@34 = ~You should know something. Imoen has been captured by the Cowled Wizards, along with Irenicus, the hooded man who attacked you! He abducted us after we left Baldur's Gate... But our top priority is saving Imoen. There's no way of knowing if she's all right. I don't want anything bad to happen to her.~
@35 = ~Before we move on, you should know that I'm trying to find Irenicus—the hooded man, your... killer. After what he did to you, he did some nasty things to me. We can't let him get away without any consequences.~
@36 = ~Let's start with walking.~
@37 = ~Ugh, that hooded man? After everything he did, he kept on scheming? As if we haven't had enough of his evil doings... Let's just hope he doesn't have, I don't know... a spare Soultaker, for example.~
@38 = ~I knew it. It's good I took comfortable shoes this time!~
@39 = ~You—you want me to leave? But why?~
@40 = ~Sorry, but I don't need your help now. Go back to Waukeen's Promenade. I'll look for you there if I need you again.~
@41 = ~Sorry, but I don't need your help now. But stay here. I'll look for you here if I need you to join me again.~
@42 = ~On second thought, I think you should stay.~
@43 = ~You can't leave me alone in this—this crypt! Not that it's MUCH of a crypt. My family's is bigger than this one. And better kept up.~ [L#2SD049]
@44 = ~Sorry, but I need to take care of Imoen. You should understand it. I'm sure you'll manage to sneak out of here. Go back to Waukeen's Promenade. I'll look for you there if I need your help again.~
@45 = ~On second thought, I think you should stay. Go back to formation.~
@46 = ~It's you! Tell me that you want me back! We can do great stuff together!~
@47 = ~Sorry, but no.~
@48 = ~Yes. We should work together again. Come, Skie.~
@49 = ~Bring me Skie, the human thief.~
@50 = ~Hey! What—I was in a shop and...~
@51 = ~...is this Hell again? <CHARNAME>, I was about to get a discount on a brand-new cloak.~
@52 = ~I'm sorry, Skie, but I need your help again. Yet again, things are getting serious.~
@53 = ~Whoops, I think I ordered the Fate Spirit to call the wrong person. Sorry.~
@54 = ~Oh, you just can't live without me, can you? Of course, you can't.~
@55 = ~Fine, I'll join you. But you owe me a nice cloak, you know!~
@56 = ~Oh, you must be joking...~
@57 = ~Hey, you—you want me to leave? But why?~
@58 = ~Sorry, I don't need your help now. But stay here. I'll look for you if you're needed again.~
@59 = ~Hey, do you know I've met Quayle before?~
@60 = ~Really? You should visit him at the circus sometimes, then! He's always happy to see his friends.~
@61 = ~Really? If only he... was still alive. I'm sure he would be more than pleased to see one of his old friends...~
@62 = ~He was always SO wrinkled. Actually, there was a time I thought he was made of nothing but wrinkles.~
@63 = ~He's still the same. But I think he actually likes those wrinkles...~
@64 = ~I know what you mean. I think he liked those wrinkles...~
@65 = ~Maybe he just wants to look like a brain himself. Well, knowing him, it's not THAT impossible, right?~
@66 = ~Maybe he just wanted to look like a brain himself. Well, knowing him, it wasn't THAT impossible, right?~
@67 = ~Well...~
@68 = ~I knew it! Ah, the wrinkled Quayle...~
@69 = ~The only thing I don't miss about him is the homework he would always give me to "make my brain grow big and strong".~
@70 = ~Aerie... Isn't it hard to take care of that hair? I mean, there's so much going on in there.~
@71 = ~It does take a moment, yes, but with those ribbons and beads... I just feel myself.~
@72 = ~Oh, don't get me wrong! It's not that I don't like them. Well, maybe that's not something I would wear myself, but they're fine with me! Oh, I once met a woman from Chult who made these astonishing barrettes! You would love them!~
@73 = ~I actually have no barrettes—~
@74 = ~And that's why you should have one! Perhaps once we're done here, we can look for one that would match your... style.~
@75 = ~I'm... I'm not sure what to say.~
@76 = ~Then just agree, silly. Oh, you don't even have to say anything. We'll just need some time to find something good. But we do take breaks from all that work, right?~
@77 = ~Oh, I bet <CHARNAME> will understand if we just disappear for an hour or two.~
@78 = ~Aerie, I was thinking, and... I wanted to tell you that it's not that I like you only because we can talk about hair and things like that. I think you're a really strong woman! You just need someone to believe in you!~
@79 = ~I... thank you, Skie. It's really nice of you. I'm really doing my best.~
@80 = ~I know. You don't give up easily. I think it's easier to be strong when someone tells you that he or she believes in you and... well, never mind. I just wanted you to know!~
@81 = ~Anyway, let's get back to work now. I want everything done as soon as possible, so we can finally rest in a nice place. Away from mud, puddles, and all the other dirty things. Oh, and I'd LOVE to take a hot bath. Mmm.~
@82 = ~It's been a while since you saw Quayle, right? You must kinda miss him.~
@83 = ~I suppose... You probably feel something similar. Baldur's Gate is far away from here, and you haven't slept in your own bed for weeks.~
@84 = ~Oh, my bed would feel so good, and I wouldn't have to worry about bugs or dirty taverns...~
@85 = ~But on the other hand, if I were to go back to all those dull duties... Well, I'm quite happy to be FAR away from Baldur's Gate.~
@86 = ~And your father? Don't you miss him?~
@87 = ~Well. I do. I guess. But if I go back, I would have to listen to his tirade. Probably it would go something like: "You are irresponsible, Skie! You should have sent me letters, so I knew you were fine and that I still had a daughter. Don't you know how horrible I felt when I thought I lost you?!"~
@88 = ~But... isn't that understandable? He must be really afraid that he might have lost you again.~
@89 = ~I suppose... But I don't want to live the life of a noble. At least not in the way people expect me to!~
@90 = ~But a letter wouldn't hurt... would it?~
@91 = ~I guess it wouldn't. FINE. I'll send him a letter. I suppose he should know I'm fine.~
@92 = ~Ugh, you're really boring, you know? Do you EVER do anything for fun?~
@93 = ~Duty isn't about fun, Skie. You should know that. I heard about your father. A truly noble and responsible man.~
@94 = ~Well, Daddy IS great, but... it's good to find time to have fun, make new friends. Do a hand care routine. By the way, you have some really nasty hands, Anomen. Buy yourself a cream or something.~
@95 = ~Excuse me?~
@96 = ~Oh, just look at them! How are you going to find a girl, or a boy, with hands like that!~
@97 = ~My hands and my love life are only my business, Skie Silvershield. I would like to keep it that way, if you don't mind.~
@98 = ~Well, we can have it your way. I just wanted to be honest with you.~
@99 = ~Hey, Anomen! Hey! Hey, Anomen!~
@100 = ~What do you need again...~
@101 = ~Nothing.~
@102 = ~So why in Helm's grace are you making all that noise, Skie?~
@103 = ~I wanted to make sure you were still alive. You're so stiff I started to worry that you might have died or something.~
@104 = ~Wanna talk, Anomen?~
@105 = ~Why would I, Skie? I understood your message the last time we talked. You find me boring. I am not going to try to change your mind.~
@106 = ~About that. Eh, you know, you could be a bit different sometimes. BUT—and I don't believe I'm saying this—I'm sorry.~
@107 = ~Fine, you're not fun. But you help <CHARNAME> a lot. So I suppose you're all right. I guess Daddy would like you. Both of you are serious about duty.~
@108 = ~Thank you, Skie. That's very mature of you.~
@109 = ~Mhm. But let's move on. I'm REALLY not used to these kinds of talks.~
@110 = ~You know so much about herbs! Have you ever thought about starting a shop with some nice natural creams and ointments?~
@111 = ~As much as I appreciate that you hold me in high esteem, I believe this oak's roots don't belong in the city soil, Skie.~
@112 = ~Oh... a pity. You know, there are very few people who can make a proper aloe ointment that wouldn't smell weird, and I believe you would be capable of doing it. And I could tell people, spread the word. Who wouldn't believe Entar Silvershield's daughter?~
@113 = ~I'm sure there aren't many people who wouldn't trust your word, Skie.~
@114 = ~Oh, that's so sweet of you!~
@115 = ~Hey, maybe you'll teach me how to make ointments? If you're not going to give the shop a chance, perhaps I should practice while I can ask you for advice and... and that would be great! Oh, just imagine it: Silverheal, a new lotion by Skie Silvershield!~
@116 = ~Yes, I can teach you about herbs and combining them, Skie. How you're going to use that knowledge, I will leave it to you. I can only hope the results will be fruitful.~
@117 = ~Oh, thank you! Maybe I should name something after you...~
@118 = ~Cedar Cernd, a new hair conditioner by Skie Silvershield. Hmm, I think I like the sound of it!~
@119 = ~Hey, Cernd! I did it! I made my very first ointment! And it DOESN'T smell bad!~
@120 = ~I'm happy you managed to put the knowledge I shared with you to use, Skie. I hope that it will bloom now, and you will become even better than you expected.~
@121 = ~You really believe that much in me? I mean, of course, you do. I just—wanted to say thanks.~
@122 = ~Here. Take it. I want you to have it. It should work well on tired muscles. And it smells of plum blossoms! You wouldn't believe how much effort it took to get that flower oil.~
@123 = ~Thank you, Skie. I'll keep it and use it when my muscles need recovery.~
@124 = ~Edwin, who's doing your piercing?~
@125 = ~What an absurd question is that, simian? Bah, don't ask about things that are none of your concern! (Why is she even talking to me? The pathetic thing with the competencies of... of a sleeping baboon!)~
@126 = ~I asked because you had fewer of them the last time I saw you! I'm just wondering if you have even more of those here and there—~
@127 = ~Well, on second thought, I don't want to know. Keep that secret knowledge to yourself.~
@128 = ~You know, I always liked Dynaheir more than you, Edwin. You're always so bossy. And frustrated.~
@129 = ~Bah! So why don't you join her in whatever hell she is in right now, foolish girl? (It would be such a pleasure to see you both burn at the same time.)~
@130 = ~But then who would stay here and remind you that red isn't this season's color? And that you are as good a fashion authority as a... dead hedgehog or something.~
@131 = ~In other words: you look bad and no one likes you, Edwin.~
@132 = ~And why should that bother me, wench?~
@133 = ~Well, maybe because I am the one who deals with traps and I may, by accident, forget to disarm one in your way, mister Duffus.~
@134 = ~Well, Irenicus may be dead, but we still have this particularly unstylish Red Wizard in the group.~
@135 = ~Ah, did you expect me to magically disappear from your worthless life, Silvershield? Dream on. (She probably thinks that only she should benefit from all this work. She can whistle for it! I deserve that gold and power more than she does...)~
@136 = ~I just hope you won't repeat his mistakes. If we stopped Irenicus, we can also stop someone like you, mister Duffus.~
@137 = ~Call me a duffus one more time, worthless baboon, and I'll make sure you will be the one to NEVER make any mistake. Ever.~
@138 = ~Pff! You know it wouldn't end well for you, right? Of course, you do.~
@139 = ~...they—I don't even want to think about it—they made, they made me... CLEAN. I had to mop up blood and vomit and, and, and, oh gods, gods—! I had to empty the bedpans for the wounded. Eugh!~ [L#2SD045]
@140 = ~Ah, my loud berrypecker, that must have been a harrowing experience for you. Still, correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't you have been more scared because you were in the crusade's hands rather than disappointed with the mundane chores they forced you to do?~
@141 = ~You just weren't there. All this smelly goo! And... and dirty soldiers! And that THING in the barrels! Oh, that thing was the WORST.~
@142 = ~And what kind of horror would they keep inside them, Skie?~
@143 = ~They—ah, I can't even say it...~
@144 = ~It was—old, musty barley soup! They would EAT BARLEY SOUP. Old and musty. Ugh!~
@145 = ~Pure horror, berrypecker! Pure horror!~
@146 = ~You're a true artist, Haer'Dalis! It's hard not to admire you! The voice! The acting! You're SO much better than Eldoth.~
@147 = ~Eldoth...?~
@148 = ~...the man I fell for. Oh, I was so naive! I liked him once, and sometime later he just left with some harlot. He couldn't even tell the difference between a good wine and... and spoiled juice!~
@149 = ~And I am better than him. Well, you must think of me "highly" then, Skie Silvershield.~
@150 = ~Well... maybe I should have put it differently. You're much better. You look good and move with grace... and... and you can do everything he couldn't!~
@151 = ~It's fine berrypecker, I won't tease you anymore. Aye, I know what you meant. And what else can I say? A pity you were so unlucky to have met a caricature of a man.~
@152 = ~A caricature of a man... What a suitable name! Oh, you're so good with words!~
@153 = ~Ah, words are, after all, this sparrow's domain. Doubt them not, and he shall tell you about miracles Eldoth has never dreamed of.~
@154 = ~I'd love that!~
@155 = ~Hey! Hear'Dalis! May I ask you something?~
@156 = ~Who would I be if I did not allow you to ask your question, Skie? What do you need this time, berrypecker? Are you hoping to hear a new story that this sparrow has to offer?~
@157 = ~Well, I would love to hear a story. You know I like them, but I would like to ask you about something else this time.~
@158 = ~I'm all ears, Skie. What do you need?~
@159 = ~Do you think you could show me another plane? I would REALLY like to see a place I have never seen before and... And you know, I have a plane-walking friend, so I thought I should give it a try and ask. So? Will you? Please?~
@160 = ~Ah, berrypecker, your curiosity and will to travel know no limits! I can promise you that if circumstances allow it, I will try to fulfill your wish. But we both know that fate can be quite capricious.~
@161 = ~Oh, thank you! I guess that knowing it's not impossible is already great! Daddy would never believe me if I told him!~
@162 = ~It's so good to see you alive, Imoen! Liia Jannath would burn the whole of Amn if something happened to you. I saw her mad once. Even Daddy tried to avoid her that day!~
@163 = ~I'm happy to see you alive too... I'm glad <CHARNAME> found a way to get you out of the Soultaker. It must have been weird for you to be inside that blade.~
@164 = ~It was weird, but... are you feeling all right?~
@165 = ~Yes, it's just... I couldn't sleep. And I'm a bit tired. But it's gonna be fine. No worries.~
@166 = ~I know the feeling, Imoen. Like—really. You know... if you ever want to talk to somebody about what happened...~
@167 = ~Thanks, Skie. And yeah, I can believe that you know the feeling. Let's just make sure he won't do that kind of nasty thing to anyone else.~
@168 = ~Of course! He won't get away next time. I promise!~
@169 = ~That thing you did to our last enemy—it was just wow, Imoen. I didn't know Duke Jannath was such a good teacher! Who would have guessed? I thought she was just some... terrifying bookworm! Not that I don't like her, she's just a bit... scary.~
@170 = ~Heh, and can't she be both a good teacher and "terrifying bookworm", as you called her?~
@171 = ~If she's both, then she's even scarier than I thought!~
@172 = ~You know, I'm happy to know that freakish mage is dead. He did nasty things to both of us. He deserved it.~
@173 = ~Irenicus did horrible things. Really horrible. But it felt weird when we found out Ellesime once had feelings for him. And that maybe he had feelings for her.~
@174 = ~You know, I loved Eldoth once. Sometimes love can make us do, think, and feel weird things. I suppose elves are no different.~
@175 = ~Yeah, I guess they're not.~
@176 = ~Uhm, weren't you traveling with that tall guy, Jaheira? You know, the one with armor and a shield. Khalar? Khaji?~
@177 = ~His name was Khalid, Skie.~
@178 = ~Was? Does it mean...~
@179 = ~I'm really sorry! I didn't mean to... Ugh... why haven't I guessed? I thought that maybe he's just taking care of something else...~
@180 = ~I know. We just...~
@181 = ~We should make sure his death wasn't for nothing, child.~
@182 = ~May I ask you about Khalid, Jaheira?~
@183 = ~Fine. Ask, Skie.~
@184 = ~Did he die because of Irenicus? Did that... creep hurt him?~
@185 = ~Yes. We found him in his dungeon. But... we barely recognized him. That monster Irenicus will pay for everything he has done.~
@186 = ~You've got my full support, Jaheira. There are a few tricks I would like to show him myself. I can show them in Khalid's name, too, you know.~
@187 = ~Thank you, Skie. But let's not allow rage to blind us. If we want to win with him, we must act thoughtfully. I don't want anyone else to join my husband.~
@188 = ~Hey, Jaheira! Do you think you'll pay Baldur's Gate a visit once it's all over? Perhaps you could tell Daddy that I did good?~
@189 = ~I haven't been making any plans. It may also depend on <CHARNAME>, the Harpers, and some other factors, Skie. Why don't you tell your father yourself that you became a respected adventurer?~
@190 = ~And if he won't believe me?~
@191 = ~People already tell tales about <CHARNAME>. You too are part of those tales. I am quite sure he will believe you.~
@192 = ~Maybe you're right. But wouldn't you like to visit Baldur's Gate at least to see me? We could go somewhere. You don't want to forget the Silvershield girl, right?~
@193 = ~No, Skie. I don't. And fine. If we'll both be in Baldur's Gate at the same time, I will let you know. I guess it won't hurt me.~
@194 = ~Great! Maybe we'll go shopping—~
@195 = ~...~
@196 = ~Or we can just talk or something.~
@197 = ~Thank you.~
@198 = ~Let's go now, child. This story isn't over yet.~
@199 = ~You don't look well, Skie! You don't look well at all. A turnip left in the sun for a week. And believe me, I saw this when we tried to dry it for the very first time with little Pico. That did not go well.~
@200 = ~No, no, no. No. No, no. Ugh, does my skin already look dry? I'm just... so thirsty. I ran out of water.~
@201 = ~Ah, you should have told me, little Silvershield, I should have something to drink I can share—~
@202 = ~—yes! Please, just give me that. Finally, something to drink...~
@203 = ~WHAT'S THAT TASTE?! BLEGH!~
@204 = ~Oh, it's turnip juice. It will make your skin smooth, moisturized, and beautiful! It's really healthy. Just look at me. Have you ever seen a single bad thing happen to my skin?~
@205 = ~You should have warned me! Ughee... I JUST WANTED SOME WATER.~
@206 = ~How do I get rid of that taste? Someone, just kill me... Please...~
@207 = ~I've got something for you, Skie!~
@208 = ~NO! I don't want anything from you, Jan! EVER.~
@209 = ~Oh, are you still mad because of that turnip juice? I told you, it's really healthy. By the way, it may be also used as a lotion for your hair. I guarantee that your hair will be beautiful, long and shiny. And its color! Oh, its color will be even deeper and just breathtaking!~
@210 = ~I bet it would be breathtaking! The stench would take away any breath in the blink of an eye!~
@211 = ~Skie, I was thinking about something. Perhaps, when we're done with the problem of the children of Bhaal, I should start my own shop in Baldur's Gate. Would you or your father be interested in sponsorship? I can guarantee all my products will be of high quality!~
@212 = ~But your products are far from great, Jan. I can still remember the taste of that turnip juice. Even thinking about it gives me the shivers...~
@213 = ~Oh, but that was an old recipe. I've made a new one for you to try! I'll remember to give you a sample once it's ready, so you could see, or rather taste, for yourself, that Jansen's products and the Jansens themselves are dependable!~
@214 = ~Please, no! I'll agree to anything, but NEVER make me drink that juice again! Neither the one made with the old recipe nor that new one.~
@215 = ~Ah, so we have a deal! Splendid! I should prepare a contract! I'm sure you'll never regret this decision, Skie! My products will make us well recognized on the market.~
@216 = ~Well, that's what I am afraid of... Maybe... let's do it differently. I will be a silent partner. No one should know that I have ANYTHING to do with it.~
@217 = ~Like EVER.~
@218 = ~You know, you remind me of Daddy, Keldorn. Can you do something for me?~
@219 = ~It depends on what you want me to do, lady Silvershield. Tell me more, and I shall give you an answer.~
@220 = ~Could you say something like: "You should GROW UP, Skie, and please—please, at least consider eating these sprouts!"~
@221 = ~Do you truly want me to do that, Skie?~
@222 = ~Yes, come on! Give it a try.~
@223 = ~You should GROW UP, Skie, and please—please, at least consider eating these sprouts!~
@224 = ~Remarkable...~
@225 = ~If only you had his accent, the two of you could be taken for brothers! Hey, maybe I SHOULD call you uncle?~
@226 = ~I believe that could give people a wrong impression, lady Silvershield. Well, it would be a pleasure to have a niece like yourself, but in the end, we're just companions.~
@227 = ~But allow me to say, Skie, that I am indeed glad to have you around. You're a gifted young woman.~
@228 = ~Oh, thank you! You really think so? And you're a fantastic unc—sir. Smarter and nicer than many knights!~
@229 = ~Could you tell me something, Keldorn?~
@230 = ~Like before, tell me how I could help you, Skie. If it's in my power, I probably will.~
@231 = ~You know, I heard many stories about... fighting wyverns and training. My dad would ALWAYS tell those stories and... most people loved them. I just want to ask you a question.~
@232 = ~Why do people always think I can't be as good as him? Is it something with my hands? Or that I have a smaller back? They don't think I can do great things without being... big and hairy or something?~
@233 = ~I'm afraid many people underestimate certain individuals. They may think of you as, and excuse me using the term, just some noble girl.~
@234 = ~Well, I kinda am a noble. No matter how boring that sounds.~
@235 = ~But... it's so stupid! And unfair!~
@236 = ~Know that I believe you can grow to be great. You already helped to save many people. You have tremendous potential, Skie Silvershield.~
@237 = ~Okay, I don't do that often, but you REALLY deserve it. Come, I owe you a hug!~
@238 = ~Thanks, Keldorn. I do appreciate what you said.~
@239 = ~Hmm, I think your hair got even whiter, Keldorn. Have you ever thought of dyeing it? I heard about some special lotions from Kara-Tur that could help.~
@240 = ~Well, I appreciate your will to help me hide my age, Skie, but it is no secret. I'm not a youngster anymore.~
@241 = ~But don't you want to at least give it a try?~
@242 = ~Let's just say that I do like my age and whatever comes with it, young lady Silvershield. Do you think it's acceptable?~
@243 = ~Fine, I suppose it is...~
@244 = ~Har! I bet Daddy never taught ye 'bout fightin'. Yer small, with small hands and arms, Skie. How don't ye break when the wind blows damn hard?~
@245 = ~Excuse me? Uh, I don't think I understood ANYTHING ow what you just said, dwarf. Hasn't your mummy taught you how to speak properly?~
@246 = ~Har, har! Someone has a sharp tongue, eh? Ye won't kill anyone with that tongue, girlie!~
@247 = ~Okay, call me a girlie ONE MORE TIME and I will just...~
@248 = ~Ye will do what... eh?~
@249 = ~I will CUT that beard of yours and... and put some weird paint on what's left!~
@250 = ~Oh, that would be something. Anyway, just keep your distance and your beard will be safe, dwarf.~
@251 = ~Ugh, what's that? What in the Nine Hells are you eating? It smells so bad!~
@252 = ~Eh? That? I cooked the little thin' that crawled near the camp. Ye want a bite, girl?~
@253 = ~No! Take it away from me! I thought you were eating... a hedgehog. Ugh, and looking at it, I wouldn't be surprised if that actually WAS a hedgehog.~
@254 = ~I think I'll throw up or something.~
@255 = ~Ugh, I think you got even smellier than before, Korgan. How is that even possible?~
@256 = ~Har, har! With all th' work and Bhaalspawnin' I am more like two ol' Korgans! Yer get it? So I sweat like two of me! Har, har! Tha' was a good one!~
@257 = ~Uhm, was that supposed to be a joke?~
@258 = ~It was! And it was good! Har!~
@259 = ~Well, no. Not really. Ugh, I can barely breathe...~
@260 = ~Please... just take a bath.~
@261 = ~You really know how to use a bow, Mazzy! You're living proof that a woman can be both strong and look good, you know!~
@262 = ~I... didn't see that coming, miss Silvershield. Thank you.~
@263 = ~Hey, you're welcome! You know, Skie Silvershield can tell when someone deserves a compliment. And, well, you really do!~
@264 = ~It's really weird. You sound like both a noble and someone who's... not a noble.~
@265 = ~I'm afraid you need to elaborate on that thought if you want me to take a stance on it, miss Silvershield.~
@266 = ~I mean... most nobles are just dull and boring and—and you are far from boring! Well, actually I believe you are NOT boring AT ALL.~
@267 = ~To be honest, I think you are inspiring, Mazzy!~
@268 = ~I appreciate that you believe so, miss Silvershield. I do my best and that's not going to change any time soon. Preferably, never.~
@269 = ~May I give you a little advice, Mazzy? NEVER ever should someone like you join the Flaming Fist. They are so boring.~
@270 = ~I'm sorry, but you have me slightly lost, Skie. Where did that come from?~
@271 = ~I'm just comparing my work here with the dull work for the Flaming Fist, and, well, it's a bit more difficult now, but on the other hand, at least it's not stupid and boring. And people are nicer! I like you, for example.~
@272 = ~Thank you, Skie. Joining the Flaming Fist wasn't among my plans, but I'll keep your words in mind.~
@273 = ~Oh, those bastards! You know, funny thing. I've been thinking more about you, Mazzy, and the Flaming Fist, and I've realized something!~
@274 = ~What have you realized, Skie? You seem angry.~
@275 = ~Because I AM angry. I've just realized that when I was working for them and didn't see a single halfling in their ranks. I... I think I joined racists! This is... IT'S—~
@276 = ~Calm down, Skie. You are no longer among them. You're here, away from the Fist. Just breathe.~
@277 = ~You know, when I go back to Baldur's Gate, I'll talk to Daddy about this. It's a bit weird and I want to know if there's some rule or if that's a coincidence. Maybe they should invite someone like you to join them. Well, not you, you would be bored to death, but... just someone else. Another halfling. Or a gnome.~
@278 = ~I really need to ask Daddy about that.~
@279 = ~Oh... you still have that hamster, Minsc. How long do hamsters live?~
@280 = ~Oh, Boo will live as long as any other hero, our sneaky friend! And that's thanks to kicking evil butts! It's really good for our health, right, Boo? *squeak*~
@281 = ~Really? Well, you both look rather... healthy. Okay, I think I can live with that. I mean with Boo. As long as you keep him away from my clothes. Do you understand, Minsc?~
@282 = ~Oh, now Boo thinks you dislike him! Why would one hero dislike another hero? Aren't we like a big butt-kicking family?~
@283 = ~Well, yeah. Maybe. I think we can be like a family. Or something familish... I suppose.~
@284 = ~Good! You heard Skie, Boo? She thinks of you as her brother!~
@285 = ~Wait, what...?~
@286 = ~That's not what I—~
@287 = ~Oh, just look at Boo, Skie! You made him really happy! You can be proud of yourself, friend! Today you have shown that heroes can care for each other!~
@288 = ~Uh, I can feel that MADNESS growing on me... Help.~
@289 = ~How do you even carry all those things, Minsc? I mean... you must be really strong. I think I saw EVERYTHING in that backpack of yours. You work out a lot, don't you?~
@290 = ~I mostly kick—~
@291 = ~Kick butts, yeah, I know. But is that all? No push-ups or anything like that? Uh, I hate that kind of exercise.~
@292 = ~Well, it's because we have heroism flowing in our blood, right, Boo? It makes us twice as big! *squeak* That and, of course, kicking evil in the butt!~
@293 = ~Well, I do the same and my pack doesn't seem any lighter...~
@294 = ~Minsc, you were supposed to keep Boo away from my pack! Shoo! Shoo! Boo, please, leave it, it's my favorite shirt!~
@295 = ~Boo just likes you! He told me that he would like to look for a present he could give you, so he decided to check something you like! Boo wants to be a good friend! Right, Boo? *squeak*~
@296 = ~Uh, that's both sweet and... not sweet, you know. Maybe you should have just asked...?~
@297 = ~But then there would be no surprise! And Boo likes surprises.~
@298 = ~I really appreciate that. I do. But... my shirt.~
@299 = ~Maybe... maybe just look for some new perfume for me. Just nothing with jasmine. Or lavender.~
@300 = ~Oh, that is an idea! Maybe something with MUSK! What do you think, Boo?~
@301 = ~I have a bad feeling about all of this...~
@302 = ~There is a reason why Boo wants to find you a perfect present, Skie. But don't tell him that you know.~
@303 = ~Well, you haven't told me anything yet.~
@304 = ~Oh, but Minsc thinks he should tell you.~
@305 = ~He's afraid that this may be our last adventure. That when it's over, you're going to leave our butt-kicking family.~
@306 = ~But... we can still meet! Talk! It doesn't have to be over, right?~
@307 = ~You think so? Ah, that would mean Boo shouldn't worry! Ah, I'll talk to him! He must know that!~
@308 = ~Right. I think you should talk to him. I never said that I don't want to see you once this is over. That's a kinda silly thing to expect.~
@309 = ~You know, don't get me wrong, Nalia, but you should talk less about helping those in need and just help yourself. You are in need, too. In need of good eye cream.~
@310 = ~You know, I really understand you want to help others, I do, but those under-eye bags... they're huge! You could hide all your gear in them and there would still be extra room!~
@311 = ~I might not have slept well, but... aren't other things more important than that? It's nothing life-changing—~
@312 = ~Well, then perhaps try doing both, helping others and yourself? Looking at those bags hurts a bit, you know. You would look so much healthier without them!~
@313 = ~So... the life of a noble bored you too, right?~
@314 = ~In a way. But what bothered me most was that many of them were always blind to so many things. Many nobles and royals I met would stick their noses in their expensive dishes and not even look around.~
@315 = ~I always hated all those diplomatic talks. Ugh, why don't they just tell each other who is stupid and who can do some good and... who can't because they don't even realize what must be done.~
@316 = ~That always bothered me. And wigs. Nobles in wigs. What were they thinking?!~
@317 = ~(laughs) Well, that was funny. You know, this guy once visited my keep... I think he was from Sembia. We were eating appetizers, he sneezed, and his toupee fell into the soup that was just served!~
@318 = ~Hah! Well, you finally saw some fun in it, girl! Good for you!~
@319 = ~Have you been thinking about your keep lately, Nalia?~
@320 = ~I wonder how the people are doing out there.~
@321 = ~Well... shouldn't they learn how to handle things without you constantly helping everyone around? Look at me. I turned out fine! And I needed A LOT of help before. Like all the time. Now—now I am an independent woman!~
@322 = ~You are, yes, but... what if they'll fail?~
@323 = ~To be a woman...?~
@324 = ~To handle issues on their own.~
@325 = ~I know! I was just joking!~
@326 = ~Anyway, neither you nor they will find out if they don't give it a try first, right?~
@327 = ~You're quite gloomy, aren't you? A pity. You're not totally bad, but this aura of bitterness around you is REALLY repelling.~
@328 = ~I am not looking for any appreciation from others, Skie. I prefer to focus on more important matters.~
@329 = ~So you don't find the fact that people don't like you a problem. Maybe if someone liked you, those Cowled guys wouldn't try to find and kill you?~
@330 = ~They do that for reasons other than my, how you called it, "bitterness".~
@331 = ~Maybe, but you're making it a bit easier for them, you know.~
@332 = ~Hey, I have a great idea! Like, really great! Hear me out, Valygar. Come on, don't get so gloomy right away!~
@333 = ~Teach me how to fight better, and in return, I'll teach you how to be less repelling. That's your chance to finally be more than the grumpy one in the group! So? You like the idea, right? I knew you would.~
@334 = ~I can teach you, Silvershield, but your lessons you should save for someone else. However, if you want my help in becoming better in battle, I'll need you to stop whining.~
@335 = ~Oh, I'm not whining! Well, not as much as I used to!~
@336 = ~Hey, Valygar! Do you think I'm doing good in battle? I practiced! A lot! I even had to shorten my nails a bit, because I would totally break them like all the time.~
@337 = ~Yes, you're doing better, Skie. But keep practicing. We all should.~
@338 = ~Oh, hey! Valygar said SOMETHING NICE? You said I'm doing great? I must remember this day. It may be the first and the last time we heard something truly encouraging from you.~
@339 = ~And that means miracles truly happen!~
@340 = ~Have you done something with your hair, Viconia? It looks amazing!~
@341 = ~Ha! You certainly know how to surprise your fellow companions with nonsense, dalhar. I appreciate the compliment, but if you think that you're going to buy some more respect with them, Skie, then you're wrong.~
@342 = ~Well, I thought you DID respect me, but—look, if I were to impress you somehow, wouldn't it be like... better to do it with my skills rather than compliments? I like your saucy attitude, but I want to be respected because of something else.~
@343 = ~The question is if you are able to impress a drow at all. You are only dalhar, after all.~
@344 = ~Dal...har?~
@345 = ~That means "a child" in common.~
@346 = ~Well, I was a kid when we first met, but I'm a woman now. Anyway, you'll see that I'm much better and... and that I can take the initiative and help in battles.~
@347 = ~Do it, Skie. Prove me wrong, and you MIGHT earn my respect.~
@348 = ~Drow women are different to those on the surface, right, Viconia?~
@349 = ~Hah! They are different, dalhar. Women here should learn about self-esteem. You could learn that, too, rather than falling for men like that scum Eldoth.~
@350 = ~Yet if it was so good down there, why did you decide to run away? I don't understand.~
@351 = ~No society is perfect, dalhar. The sooner you realize that, the better.~
@352 = ~Do you see any good sides of being here, Viconia?~
@353 = ~What do you mean? I am not among my people here, isn't that good enough?~
@354 = ~It's hard to get your point. One day you hate humans and surface elves. The next day you are glad you are no longer among the drow...~
@355 = ~I told you once, dalhar, no society is perfect. What else do you want to know?~
@356 = ~Why are you here? With us?~
@357 = ~It's safer. And maybe I've lost my mind, dalhar, because I want you to get your chance to impress me.~
@358 = ~Hmm, I'm surprised. I thought you would die not long after joining this group. But you survived. Somehow. Perhaps you're not as pathetic as I thought you to be, Silvershield girl.~
@359 = ~Wait, does that mean I actually... impressed you?~
@360 = ~Surprised. And yes. I will say it only once, j'nesst: I... may have misjudged you. You may be stronger than I thought.~
@361 = ~Really? I managed to impress Viconia De'Vir. I knew I would do it!~
@362 = ~Uh, stop making so much noise, j'nesst, or I will change my mind.~
@363 = ~Wait, you use that word for the second time... j'nesst? I'm no longer... uhm... dalhar?~
@364 = ~You deserve to be called j'nesst. Dalhar is a child. But after what I have seen, I may call you a woman.~
@365 = ~OH MY... <CHARNAME>, I'm afraid someone may have swapped Viconia with a doppelganger. This Viconia is WAY too nice to me.~
@366 = ~I'm done with this conversation. And don't make me regret changing my opinion about you, Skie.~
@367 = ~Now move on, we have better things to do than wasting time on discussions like this one.~
@368 = ~Oh, you must have seen wonders on the way here, right, Yoshimo? Kozakura is so far away!~
@369 = ~Indeed, my chatty partner, Yoshimo saw both wonders and peculiarities when traveling here, to Amn.~
@370 = ~Oh, I wish I could see all those lands you traveled through. You must have eaten so many different things and seen people wearing stylish clothes.~
@371 = ~People miss so much when they stay home!~
@372 = ~Well said, Skie Silvershild, but you made me wonder: how did this little kitty decide to leave in the very first place, eh? Was it this urge to see the world?~
@373 = ~Ah, no. It was love. But later he turned out to be nothing else but a harlot-loving bastard.~
@374 = ~So, it was a romantic impulse to follow some fool, yes? So many tales start that way, Skie. You may yet write one of them!~
@375 = ~Some of your traps seem really complicated! They must be difficult to set. Are they?~
@376 = ~Some, yes, but their effectiveness matches their complexity, Skie. That's why I set them.~
@377 = ~Well, I saw how they work. That little string—this is what makes them work so well, right?~
@378 = ~Ah, so little Skie has quite an eye! Indeed, that little string does the trick. An important one. It triggers the mechanism.~
@379 = ~Oh, I wish I could do wonders like that! But on the other hand, at least there are things each of us does better. You can set your special traps and I—I know much about fashion and... and nobles. And how boring they are.~
@380 = ~You're slowing us down, girl. You talk too much and walk too slowly.~
@381 = ~This is so stupid! <CHARNAME>, why are we letting him walk with us? I guess I need to remind you that Daddy was killed because of him. Don't you remember that?~
@382 = ~It was a long time ago, Silvershield, and your father was in my way. He knew the possible consequences.~
@383 = ~Can't we sort it out somehow? We have enough enemies, so stop starting new wars. Please.~
@384 = ~Calm down. Both of you. We have one goal right now, so stop thinking about the past. Your father is back, and we killed Sarevok once already.~
@385 = ~This is so stupid. He should have stayed dead.~
@386 = ~He was the one who actually started a REAL war, you know. This is so stupid. I don't want to work with him...~
@387 = ~...I'm not supposed to peel potatoes!~ [L#2SD041]
@388 = ~And what else can you do, girl? You had to be saved once already. You're wasting our time and energy.~
@389 = ~You're really mean, Dorn. No wonder your old group tricked you. Is there anyone who would be happy to have you around?~
@390 = ~Ha! At least I don't have to be babysat, Silvershield. Go and peel potatoes. Maybe you will prove to be good at something. I doubt it, though.~
@391 = ~...I am done with all your comments, Dorn. You're nothing but a bully! No better than... than Eldoth!~
@392 = ~Actually I'm much better than him. As a man and as a warrior. Better in bed and when facing foes. It is you who are as worthless as that damn bard.~
@393 = ~One more word, Dorn, and... and I will lose my patience! You're nasty. I hope you'll die the next time we're attacked!~
@394 = ~Ugh, wherever we look there's a Child of Bhaal. Here, there. Around the corner. I wouldn't be surprised to find one in my wardrobe.~
@395 = ~Perhaps we'll find out that Dorn is a Child of Bhaal too. I mean the more Sarevokish kind, not one like you, <CHARNAME>.~
@396 = ~Children of Bhaal aren't the only men and women who can make it all tense, girl. I can cause you quite a lot of trouble without Bhaal's essence.~
@397 = ~Yeah, we know. "Raargh, I am a big half-orc who had a troubled childhood, and now I want to crash and smash! I want blood! Rargh!"~
@398 = ~You are like the guy in the bar who keeps telling one story over and over again until everyone is fed up with it.~
@399 = ~And now I'm done talking to you.~
@400 = ~Hey, what's that glow—~
@401 = ~Oh, I'm so sorry! Are you okay, Skie? I just wanted to summon some heat as I got a bit cold and... there was a small surge.~
@402 = ~And what's THAT! That thing on your hand!~
@403 = ~What are you talking a—Oh! Oh! Get off me!~
@404 = ~Okay, that was unexpected. Double surge, I guess —a blinding flash and... some weirdish scolopendra. But it's gone. Somewhere. I can't see it. Let's hope it's gone forever.~
@405 = ~Please, please, please, please, don't summon any more scolopendras, Neera! They really freak me out!~
@406 = ~Well, I'll try! And again—sorry.~
@407 = ~I don't get it. Why some people are afraid of your magic. It's hard to call it dull! And even though I did not like the scolopendra you called last time, that was something... memorable! Right, that's a fine way of describing it.~
@408 = ~Well, I suppose that's because they are afraid it may bury them alive or—or turn into a giant mouse. But, hey, isn't life a bit like my magic? You never know what you'll get or see just behind the corner!~
@409 = ~There can be a shop... or a crazy necromancer trying to summon an army of ghouls. We know that's possible. We've been there before, right? Because what else was Korlasz trying to do? What can you do in a crypt, right?~
@410 = ~Right! I think you're right. I think I like the way you think. Perhaps we should go shopping sometime?~
@411 = ~Hey, Neera! Do you have a spell to heat my water? I think I'm going to be sick, and I would kill for some hot water. Or a tea.~
@412 = ~Uhm, and aren't you afraid that something weird may happen? That the waterskin will become alive and run away from you or something? You know it's possible, right?~
@413 = ~It's worth a try. And if something like that happens, I'll just assume that I got worse and I'm hallucinating.~
@414 = ~Well... We can give it a try, but maybe when we stop, right? It would be weird to run after a living waterskin and then get attacked! That was awkward. I-I mean could be awkward~
@415 = ~Fine...~
@416 = ~Don't take it personally, Rasaad, but how do you avoid being bored to death when listening to your own words? I think I would rather clean the entire Silvershield estate than listen to that.~
@417 = ~Perhaps you're not listening carefully, Skie, so you can't—~
@418 = ~BORING. You're already being patronizing. And that dreary tone. You're worse than my history teacher, Rasaad. Perhaps... you should try to work on it?~
@419 = ~I must admit that I never thought about my tone. I'm afraid you would need to be more specific about what you consider to be wrong with it.~
@420 = ~The pace? The intonation. You sound as if you were giving a very boring lesson. Like VERY boring. Even for yourself. As if someone sucked out all the excitement from your life.~
@421 = ~I see. Well, I must say, I didn't know you find it that tedious. I may need to think about this, Skie.~
@422 = ~So, are you mad at me, Rasaad? For telling you what I think about the way you speak and so on.~
@423 = ~No. I do not blame people for saying what they believe. You are entitled to your opinion.~
@424 = ~Okay, even when you're being nice, you sound... Eh, never mind. Let's just go.~
@425 = ~Rasaad, do you remember when we talked, and I compared you to a teacher?~
@426 = ~Yes, I remember that. Is there something else you would like to add to that, Skie?~
@427 = ~I was thinking, and perhaps you SHOULD be a teacher. You already tell everyone what they should do to "achieve balance", so...~
@428 = ~That's certainly something I could consider. But everything depends on what's going to happen next and if that will be something people expected and needed.~
@429 = ~I'm quite sure you would enjoy that kind of work.~
@430 = ~I'm not sure if I should adore you Hexxat or fear you.~
@431 = ~Can't you do both?~
@432 = ~Well, I can, but it would be so much easier to pick one. You remind me of a girl I once met—she had this mysterious atmosphere all around her! You have that too! Oh, I wonder how you looked when you were alive!~
@433 = ~That you will never find out, Skie Silvershield.~
@434 = ~You know, those short replies just enhance that aura of yours. If I liked women THAT WAY, maybe I would fall for you! Yeah, I probably would.~
@435 = ~That fall would probably be deadly for you.~
@436 = ~With you around, I feel I might be a bit like a spare pair of shoes. They may be glamorous, but still, they are just spare shoes.~
@437 = ~Then find a feature that would make them useful in certain situations. After all, you are the one who gives those shoes a purpose.~
@438 = ~Hexxat, have you ever stolen something even though you didn't want to?~
@439 = ~Yes.~
@440 = ~Did it feel weird? Because sometimes I wonder... you know, I did many things. Stole stuff. Sneaked into places. Said many things. And I suppose... we all have regrets, right?~
@441 = ~Is there a reason why you're asking me this question, Skie?~
@442 = ~I like you. And I think you're really skilled. And smart. I thought you'd be a good person to ask.~
@443 = ~I see.~
@444 = ~What I know is people have regrets and there is no reason why you should be different.~
@445 = ~I suppose you're right. And... thanks.~
@446 = ~Well, with that fur on, Wilson, you will never be out of fashion!~
@447 = ~Rff, sniff.~
@448 = ~Oh, of course, I'm serious, Wilson! I think it looks amazing!~
@449 = ~Grr.~
@450 = ~What? No! I would never even think of taking it away from you. Wilson looks best in Wilson's fur. No one else will EVER look better in it.~
@451 = ~Growl. Snuffle, snort.~
@452 = ~You're welcome!~
@453 = ~I think I have a cold...~
@454 = ~Sniff. Roar.~
@455 = ~Really? You would let me sleep next to you tonight? I suppose it would be warmer and... such a big bear would probably protect me from the wind...~
@456 = ~Sniff, rff.~
@457 = ~You would really do that for me? Really? You're the best bear ever, Wilson.~
@458 = ~You know, I think you may now be the most powerful bear EVER, Wilson.~
@459 = ~Roar, rff.~
@460 = ~Okku? And who's Okku?~
@461 = ~Snuffle, rff. Sniff.~
@462 = ~A bear god? I didn't know there are any bear gods.~
@463 = ~Anyway, I think you are greater than any bear god. You are nice and... and you fought great enemies. And you made great friends!~
@464 = ~Rff. Snort.~
@465 = ~Well, yes. I hope to be one of them, Wilson. I like you. And you're so soft!~
@466 = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>! Wait! I want to talk. Hey—you walk quite fast, you know. Anyway, there's something I'd like to ask you. Do you have a moment?~
@467 = ~Sure. What do you need? I'm all ears.~
@468 = ~Eh, I hope it's important. What do you need? Make it quick.~
@469 = ~I'm sorry, Skie, but we have no time for this. We should focus on our work, so get back to formation, and let's go.~
@470 = ~Fine, but don't be so mean. You don't want to be like Eldoth, right? You shouldn't.~
@471 = ~Can you tell me more about how you ended up in Athkatla? I heard that by the time you left Baldur's Gate the relationship status between you and the city was described as... complicated?? With all that fuss about me, your daddy, my daddy, and... the Dukes. I suppose things like that happen when everyone is SO tense!~
@472 = ~And all of a sudden, you're here, so far from Baldur's Gate.~
@473 = ~I mentioned before that I was kidnapped and brought here. That hooded man, Irenicus... It looks like he had a plan that involved hurting you and ruining my reputation... I suppose he wanted to have me banished? Either way, I left the city, and his people were there, waiting for me in an ambush.~
@474 = ~I really don't want to talk about this, Skie. I need you in my group, but because I need someone with your skills. Not because I need a friend. Do you understand?~
@475 = ~He's the worst! Some creep in weird clothes, walking around with some deadly blade thing and—and playing with people as if they were puppets or something. I hate him.~
@476 = ~Well, then you're not alone. He tricked all of us. He ran some magic tests on me. And now Imoen got captured, and we can't rule out that she's being kept in some prison WITH him.~
@477 = ~That's why he must be stopped. Not because I want to get even, but because he's dangerous. He hurt people. And Imoen is probably stuck with him.~
@478 = ~Look, that's not something I want to talk about. I'm still thinking about our next step and you're distracting me.~
@479 = ~Tests? I can't blame you for wanting a rev—~
@480 = ~I agree. He must be st—~
@481 = ~Wait, what did you just say? IMOEN IS WITH HIM? When I was joining your group, you said the Cowled Wizards took her… And you mentioned him too, right, but... Oh, Jannath would be SO furious. She would just tear Amn apart to find her. We're getting her back, right? Of course, we are. Stupid question.~
@482 = ~Wait, what did you just say? IMOEN IS WITH HIM? You mentioned Irenicus when I was joining, but you said nothing about Imoen. Oh, Jannath would be SO furious. She would just tear Amn apart to find her. We're getting her back, right? Of course, we are, stupid question.~
@483 = ~Wait, what did you just say? IMOEN IS WITH HIM? You didn't tell me about Imoen when you let me join. Oh, Jannath would be SO furious. She would just tear Amn apart to find her. We're getting her back, right? Of course, we are, stupid question.~
@484 = ~Your life got kinda complicated since I last saw you. Is there anything else I should know? Did black go out of fashion? Is Faerûn falling apart?~
@485 = ~I hope not. I love black.~
@486 = ~I hope not. Faerûn was fine the last time I checked. It's just my life that became a mess.~
@487 = ~It's not funny, Skie. Get a bit more serious. The situation is hard enough, don't make it worse.~
@488 = ~Can you stop asking so many questions? And please, don't distract me so often. Let's get back to work.~
@489 = ~Me too, but that thing with Imoen and... that creep...~
@490 = ~Quite a big mess. And that thing with Imoen and... that creep...~
@491 = ~Hey! I am serious! I like Imoen and I just found out that creep is near her!~
@492 = ~Look, you helped me, so now I'm helping you. And Imoen. I'm not letting this creep do things to you—whatever he's actually doing. Not on my watch.~
@493 = ~Eh, now I sound like Corporal Duncan. Do you see what that Flaming Fist episode did to me?~
@494 = ~Hey, don't be so mean, okay? That was WAY too mean.~
@495 = ~It was weird to see you walk up to me with that dagger. You know, at the Dragonspear Castle.~
@496 = ~But you know it wasn't you who I saw, right? I would never stab you.~
@497 = ~I guess I would feel just as confused if I were in your place, Skie.~
@498 = ~I never apologized for everything that happened. If only I could have resisted Irenicus.~
@499 = ~We don't have time for this. Let's get back to work.~
@500 = ~I know! You really thought—you thought I would blame you?! Hey!~
@501 = ~Everyone would, right? That was his plan.~
@502 = ~What? You think I—don't be stupid! It was his plan. Why would you apologize? Stop it, will you?~
@503 = ~Apparently, this Irenicus can create weirdish illusions, and they covered us like mold. Right. Ugly, smelly mold. And it made stuff nasty. We should all blame him and his stupid ego.~
@504 = ~Anyway, don't think I EVER thought it was your fault. We never swore to be best friends forever, but I trust you. I know, I trusted Eldoth once, but I learned much since then!~
@505 = ~Thanks, Skie. I'm glad to hear that. Especially in these difficult times.~
@506 = ~Huh, I always wondered why in all gods' sake you trusted Eldoth. He was so obvious in his lies.~
@507 = ~It's all very nice, but can we go now? I'm done talking, to be honest. I'd rather get back to work.~
@508 = ~Sure. But you know what's always a good idea in difficult times? Shopping.~
@509 = ~Go on. Buy something. New clothes. Some tea. A bow. Whatever works for you!~
@510 = ~I loved him. And I really wanted to change something in my life. I saw this as my chance and—~
@511 = ~He tricked me, but at least he got me out of that estate. That's already something, right?~
@512 = ~Hey, don't be dull, will you?~
@513 = ~Could you tell me more about that person who took my place? In the Soultaker.~
@514 = ~Her name was Pyll, and she was sick. She did it because she wanted to do something good before she was gone. I believe she had regrets about her past.~
@515 = ~His name was Roi "Biggie" and he was a thief. He was afraid that he would be sentenced to death or locked up for the rest of his life. He had a son and agreed to take your place if I helped him to secure his son's future. And that I did.~
@516 = ~His name was Bontt. He was a swashbuckler. He was injured, and he would have died anyway, so I... told him what he could do. And how that would save him some pain.~
@517 = ~I don't know who that truly was. The only thing I cared about was saving you. That was my priority, not listening to what they wanted to tell me.~
@518 = ~Just don't think about them, Skie. You're out of that blade, and that is the only thing that matters.~
@519 = ~I don't have time to waste on talking about someone who's not even part of this world anymore. Come, we should be moving.~
@520 = ~Pyll... I'll remember that name. I owe her my life, right? And you, of course.~
@521 = ~Roi... he must have cared for his son. That's good. It's always good to have a great dad.~
@522 = ~Bontt... he sounds like a shady kind of guy... but he helped me. So... I'm grateful. To him and to you.~
@523 = ~Thank you for telling me. I was thinking about this for a while and—it's just good to finally know.~
@524 = ~Hey! It was a stupid thing to say, <CHARNAME>. That person saved me, too, right? Just like you. Even though I never met them, I feel REALLY grateful. It must be kinda hard to sacrifice yourself for someone you don't even know.~
@525 = ~There has always been a group of people who cared about me, you know. Like Daddy. Or my dancing teacher, a great woman. I guess I'm quite lucky, right?~
@526 = ~You are, Skie.~
@527 = ~You are. You know, I'm actually a bit jealous of that thing you have with your father. It must be great to have someone like that.~
@528 = ~I believe that every person should know what's best for them. You should learn how to take care of yourself, Skie, instead of wondering who may help you.~
@529 = ~I don't know, and I don't really care. Can we move on and waste no more time, Skie? I tire of this.~
@530 = ~Right.~
@531 = ~Oh, right! You don't know how it is. Well, having a dad is great. They can preach sometimes, but at least they care. Usually. But—I guess I should stop here, right? Somehow I doubt you want to listen to this.~
@532 = ~Hey, I can take care of myself! Don't you remember? I spied on the crusade. Maybe I got into some trouble, but... I helped! In a way. And I DO want to think about those who helped me. If it weren't so, I wouldn't think about you AND I wouldn't have set off to find you.~
@533 = ~Anyway, isn't it time to move a bit? I don't want to go totally mawkish and... and maybe we'll find some nice new shops or other stuff to do.~
@534 = ~Pfff! That's mean. Is that you, <CHARNAME>, or maybe that's Eldoth in disguise?~
@535 = ~My head hurts... Does anyone have any herbs that could help? Please...?~
@536 = ~It's been a while since I heard you talking about headaches. Or that your feet hurt. Or about broken nails. Did something happen?~
@537 = ~Skie, I need you to pull yourself together, so we could focus on our work. I, too, have bad days, but I don't walk to and fro complaining.~
@538 = ~Did I really complain that much? I couldn't have been that bad. Could I?~
@539 = ~Anyway, I couldn't sleep. And now the head. I think that Soultaker fed on me somehow. I don't know how or why. I—I hope it choked on me. Stupid thing.~
@540 = ~Or maybe it's because your soul was too long out of your body. But it's still better than death.~
@541 = ~Hah, I bet it choked on you. And me. Both of us, actually. I created that anomaly inside it. I think that counts.~
@542 = ~Just deal with it, Skie, and let us get back to work, will you?~
@543 = ~You say that because you don't feel that ache.~
@544 = ~I guess it does. Eh, but now I feel as if I had some weirdness in my head.~
@545 = ~But okay, fine. I'm not going to talk about it anymore. I'll just look for some herbs. Somewhere. Maybe I have something in my pack. I'll check... for the fifth time.~
@546 = ~Just to make sure... the soul that replaced mine in that thing. Will the blade drain it too? Or feed on it? Or do other nasty things?~
@547 = ~Nem told me that it wouldn't hurt. That now it's going to be like an endless slumber for them, so I don't think so. I guess that thing I did there, inside the Soultaker, changed how it works.~
@548 = ~Sorry, Skie, but I'm no specialist in soul-sucking blades and their nature. And to be honest, I would like to move on instead of talking about things we know nothing about. It's just a waste of time.~
@549 = ~Good. I guess. This sounds better than being some "soulish snack".~
@550 = ~Anyway, I've been talking too much about everything that happened. It was important, of course. I'll have to live with results, but we should talk about nicer things now, right? Like—like shops! Discounts! New clothing collections!~
@551 = ~Is it weird that these interest me a tiny bit less than before? I still LOVE them, but a tiny bit less...~
@552 = ~...OH NO...~
@553 = ~What if that blade sucked that love out of me?!~
@554 = ~But you just said that it's still there. Mostly. Maybe you just started to care about other things, too?~
@555 = ~Gods, you're insane. Can we stop talking about you and start working? You should know we're here for a reason.~
@556 = ~Maybe you're right.~
@557 = ~Eh, sorry my old passions, you have to make some space for a few additional interests. But don't go anywhere. I promise we'll go shopping soon.~
@558 = ~Weren't you nicer before? I think you were.~
@559 = ~Don't you think Baldur's Gate seems boring compared to Athkatla?~
@560 = ~What do you mean? I think you need to expand on that thought.~
@561 = ~I actually prefer Baldur's Gate. It has this atmosphere I rather enjoy.~
@562 = ~I agree. Somehow, Athkatla looks more impressive. I suppose that's because of its architecture.~
@563 = ~I'm not going to waste my time talking about cities, Skie. We should move on.~
@564 = ~Hmm, let's do it differently: imagine that Baldur's Gate and Athkatla are two women—or men. Whichever you like. Which of them would seem more interesting? You have to pick one.~
@565 = ~Hmm, I think I would pick Baldur's Gate.~
@566 = ~I think I would pick Athkatla.~
@567 = ~Eh, I'm not going to waste my time talking about cities, Skie. We should move on.~
@568 = ~Really? I mean, it's great that you like my home town...~
@569 = ~...but I would pick Athkatla.~
@570 = ~Hey, me too! I would pick Athkatla over Baldur's Gate.~
@571 = ~Don't get me wrong, I like Baldur's Gate. It's just—Athkatla is less boring. That huge Promenade. Or a district full of temples with those glowing and swirling things inside. Or an entire district built on a BRIDGE. That's insane, isn't it? Oh, I like it so much!~
@572 = ~In other words: I think Athkatla may surprise you. Baldur's Gate? Em... not really.~
@573 = ~But on the other hand, I have never seen so much poverty like in Athkatla's slums.~
@574 = ~It also depends on what you're expecting from a city. Not everyone wants to be "surprised by the city". Some may just want to... live peacefully.~
@575 = ~Still, I really like the Elfsong Tavern in Baldur's Gate. I have never seen better wine and cosier beds.~
@576 = ~Eh, I think I'm done talking about cities, Skie. Can't we just move on? Please.~
@577 = ~There's poverty in Baldur's Gate, too! I know because Daddy had to deal with it from time to time.~
@578 = ~Ugh, I would literally die of boredom.~
@579 = ~Elfsong is fine, but Daddy would never permit me to go to taverns openly. I had to sneak out, so I've only been there a couple of times.~
@580 = ~Anyway, our talk made me think about Baldur's Gate a bit. Do you think that the city got back to normal already? You know, after the whole crusade business.~
@581 = ~Shouldn't you know that? You were there last.~
@582 = ~It always takes time. It's really hard to tell.~
@583 = ~I don't know. I don't care. Can we just move on?~
@584 = ~When I woke up, people were still dealing with some stuff. You know, they had those tents set up for the refugees. But I guess they're fine now. I hope so.~
@585 = ~Eh, I guess you're right... There were a lot of refugees. But I hope they're fine now!~
@586 = ~I talked to some of them, you know? It was FAR better than sitting at home and waiting for Daddy and others to come up with a plan. I hate waiting. Who has time for waiting? People should wait less and do more!~
@587 = ~Anyway, they had so many stories to tell! But some stupid people preferred to be mean and fight rather than talk.~
@588 = ~But hey, I guess you'd like to move on, right? Come! Let's go and do great things.~
@589 = ~Fine. But how about you stop ruling this group with such an iron fist? It's getting old.~
@590 = ~Hey! I've got a SURPRISE for you!~
@591 = ~Oh, really? What would it be?~
@592 = ~I love surprises! So? Tell me! What have you got?~
@593 = ~I have no time for this, Skie. We stopped to have some rest, not to waste more time.~
@594 = ~You know, I've been thinking about how to make this whole adventuring nicer, and then I realized: you rarely have time for simple pleasures! And then I knew what we needed.~
@595 = ~We need some WINE TIME! Look! I've got a bottle of Sembian wine! It's from Château Blah-blah!~
@596 = ~Blah-blah?! That famous Blah-blah?!~
@597 = ~Wait, that's not a real name, right?~
@598 = ~We have no time for these kinds of pleasures, Skie. I need both you and me to be focused and sharp.~
@599 = ~I could NEVER remember those Sembian... winemakers? Wine houses? You know what I mean.~
@600 = ~So? Are you ready to have some wine and talk with your best friend, Skie? Of course you are! Right...?~
@601 = ~Open that wine already. (wink)~
@602 = ~Uhm... why not. I suppose we can have some wine and chat.~
@603 = ~Sorry, I don't drink alcohol. But we can talk.~
@604 = ~We have no time for this, and I think you misunderstood your place in the group. Leave me alone and have some rest yourself.~
@605 = ~Oh, great! It's been so long since I had some wine with a friend, a nice chat—and all that stuff. And here is your share of the wine.~
@606 = ~Mmm. It's SO good! I didn't know it would be that good. The best... Blah-blah I've ever had!~
@607 = ~It's good. But you wanted to talk, right?~
@608 = ~I've had better. But anyway, you wanted to tell me something.~
@609 = ~Really? I mean, sure. We can just talk. Or I'll have some wine. It would be a pity to waste it, right?~
@610 = ~Hey, it's SO good! I didn't know it would be that good. Best... Blah-blah I've ever had!~
@611 = ~I'm glad you like it. Anyway, you wanted to tell me something.~
@612 = ~Just don't drink too much. Now, you wanted to tell me something, yes?~
@613 = ~Right. You know. I wanted to thank you. For—for ALL OF THIS. Adventuring! Saving me! Showing me all those weird and spooky things. It's better than anything I have seen since I snuck out of the Silvershield estate.~
@614 = ~It was you who decided to give it a shot. And even after hundreds of headaches and a few dozen broken nails, you're still here. On the road.~
@615 = ~You're welcome. You know, I am surprised. I thought you would still be complaining, whining, and making all that noise... You used to be really annoying.~
@616 = ~You speak to me as if we were best friends. But you should know that you're just a companion to me. Do you understand me?~
@617 = ~You really think that...? Oh, how nice of you. Really. People rarely tell me nice things. Apart from Daddy and some other people, but—it's different. You're my friend, after all, right? Not family or a butler.~
@618 = ~Wow. You're honest to the bone, huh? But you used past tense, so I guess you think differently of me now.~
@619 = ~Anyway, this life is better. It gives me more blisters and—and other nasty things, but it's better. That's why I wanted to thank you. You're a good friend.~
@620 = ~You're a good friend, too, Skie.~
@621 = ~No problem. Always at your service, miss Silvershield!~
@622 = ~I think you misunderstood me, Skie. We're not friends. We just work together.~
@623 = ~Hey, thanks! Uhm—it's probably getting too sweet, right?~
@624 = ~Hah! Thanks, friend! Uhm—it's getting a bit too sweet, right?~
@625 = ~Let's end it for today, <CHARNAME>. Hah, that wind is... kinda strong, no? It's... more potent than... other potent things.~
@626 = ~Sleep well, bestie. I think I need to have some sleep. *hic*~
@627 = ~Uhm... okay... I thought we were friends, not just some partners in chasing Irenicus. But never mind. I think I'll just go now and have some sleep.~
@628 = ~Well, I thought we would sit and talk for a while, but if I'm asking for too much...~
@629 = ~Ugh... is it time to move on? My head hurts. I suppose that's the price for having some wine with friends, right? What a cruel price...~
@630 = ~Lady Silvershield! So you're with <CHARNAME>, after all! Everyone has been looking for you! Your father is so worried!~
@631 = ~Missini? Uhm—It's good to see you. But how did you find me?~
@632 = ~It wasn't that difficult. We had a feeling you went to find <CHARNAME>. Yet <CHARNAME> is constantly moving, so tracking <PRO_HISHER> current location was the only tricky part.~
@633 = ~Your father and Duke Jannath ordered me to find you. They want you to come back. They worry that you may not be safe with this <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@634 = ~I'm fine. See? Both arms are here. Both legs too! Just tell Daddy I'm okay and that... I'm not going back.~
@635 = ~You know that they won't be happy with that answer, Lady Silvershield.~
@636 = ~Oh, don't be so dull. We both know you understand me, Missini. You, too, love those missions Liia sends you on. You like that thrill and—and everything.~
@637 = ~You know that I can't admit it openly, Lady—~
@638 = ~Can you stop with that "Lady" thing? I'm Skie. Just call me Skie.~
@639 = ~Fine, L... Skie. Are you sure you want to stay here? With <CHARNAME>?~
@640 = ~I'M SURE. How many times do I have to say this? I'm fine and even if it's risky, I want to take that risk.~
@641 = ~Tell Daddy that I love him, but I want to decide how to live my life on my own. He always wanted me to become smarter and better. That's what I'm doing here.~
@642 = ~Duke Entar... he knew you might say something like that. He prepared this letter. It's for <CHARNAME>. Here. Take it. He also sends you another gift. It's for both you and Skie.~
@643 = ~Eh, a letter? He loves letters. I wouldn't be surprised if he prepared three different letters depending on what I would say.~
@644 = ~Skie...?~
@645 = ~Yes, Missini?~
@646 = ~Do your best. And watch out for yourself.~
@647 = ~I will.~
@648 = ~Goodbye, Skie. And goodbye, <CHARNAME>. As we can see, you have a loyal friend here with you.~
@649 = ~It wasn't that difficult. We had a feeling you wanted to find <CHARNAME>. Yet <CHARNAME> is constantly moving, so tracking <PRO_HISHER> current location the only tricky part.~
@650 = ~I...~
@651 = ~Lady Silvershield?~
@652 = ~<CHARNAME> can be mean sometimes...~
@653 = ~...but I don't want to leave yet. I want to give <PRO_HIMHER> another chance. <CHARNAME> saved my life, remember?~
@654 = ~Yet you said <PRO_HESHE> is mean to you sometimes.~
@655 = ~So? Daddy can be mean sometimes, too. I'm staying. If I decide that what <CHARNAME> is doing isn't right, I'll just leave. But until then, I want to stay.~
@656 = ~I understand.~
@657 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have a letter Duke Entar prepared. He wanted me to give you this if Lady Skie decided to stay. He knew that might happen.~
@658 = ~Lady... Please, watch out for yourself.~
@659 = ~Goodbye, Skie. And goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@660 = ~You're right. <CHARNAME> was mean and <PRO_HESHE> did bad things. That's not the hero I remembered.~
@661 = ~<CHARNAME>, I thought you were better than Eldoth, but... you're bad for me. You've done horrible things to others. That's not the Hero of Baldur's Gate I wanted to see.~
@662 = ~What's your order, Lady?~
@663 = ~Take us out of here.~
@664 = ~You should have been a better <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. Things could have gone differently. Thanks for saving my life, but—this is over.~
@665 = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@666 = ~I guess they won't bother us again. Anyway, you heard what I said... I think I have nothing else to add. In fact, I would rather just get back to work, okay? It was all a bit awkward.~
@667 = ~Let's go. Let's do some great things, right?~
@668 = ~Sure, but... thanks for staying.~
@669 = ~Let's just get moving.~
@670 = ~Great! So? Where are we going now? I'm right behind you.~
@671 = ~No problem! I want to see what this world can offer me. And I think it's good to check that with you.~
@672 = ~Come. Let's get going!~
@673 = ~What—WHY ARE WE WALKING ON SOME MEAT?! Ugh, this place is disgusting. And that smell...~
@674 = ~Well, I did not expect that.~
@675 = ~It seems that we're in some weird lair.~
@676 = ~Stop whining. Just hold your breath and let's move on, Skie.~
@677 = ~Places like that should NEVER exist. And that... plop you can hear with every step. *shivers*~
@678 = ~Isn't that funny? I actually like that plop. It's like walking on a huge tongue.~
@679 = ~I know, but we're here for a reason, Skie. We must get past it somehow.~
@680 = ~Stop whining already. We're not here to have fun, but because the situation demands it. Now let us move on.~
@681 = ~Okay, if you're really enjoying this, then there's something seriously wrong with you.~
@682 = ~I know, but... it's still just—bleh.~
@683 = ~Let's do what we must and leave this place as soon as possible, okay?~
@684 = ~Ugh... this must be some weird nightmare.~
@685 = ~They're just as boring as the Flaming Fist. All they do is work and pray.~ [L#2SD033]
@686 = ~Well, what else did you expect them to do? It's a paladin order.~
@687 = ~It's not as bad as it looks. They do many other things, too.~
@688 = ~Skie, please. You should keep those comments to yourself!~
@689 = ~You were a Flaming Fist member. Does that mean you want to join the Order of the Radiant Heart as well?~
@690 = ~Right. But they could be doing so many better and NICER things. But they do THIS. Consciously. Freaks.~
@691 = ~Hey, how about we check their boxes and chests? Maybe we'll find something useful.~
@692 = ~I hope so. If they don't, then—well, then we can be sure orders like this attract loonies.~
@693 = ~I have an idea! Let's check their boxes and chests! Maybe we'll find something useful.~
@694 = ~Pff! And maybe—maybe you should keep your orders to yourself, hmm?~
@695 = ~Hah. Well... no. If I ever join any order, that will mean I'm no longer Skie Silvershield, but some freakish doppelganger.~
@696 = ~Anyway, let's move on. And by the way, if you're thinking that checking their boxes and chests is a good idea, I totally agree.~
@697 = ~You fixed that thing? Are you sure it's a good idea?~
@698 = ~No worries, Skie. It may look like the old Soultaker, but it no longer has its original powers.~
@699 = ~Oh, just stop it, will you? It's just a dagger. And it can't steal souls anymore, so stop moaning.~
@700 = ~Right... I've had my portion of the whole soul-sucking experience. I want to be sure that my soul won't get sucked in again because I cut myself peeling an apple or something.~
@701 = ~I'm pretty sure it's not the way it works, Skie.~
@702 = ~Oh, just quit whining and let us move on, will you?~
@703 = ~I know! Do you think I'm stupid? I—I'm just not really fond of that item. No wonder, huh?~
@704 = ~...but you said it works differently now, right? Do you know how?~
@705 = ~I think it has some healing properties. I feel much better when I'm holding it.~
@706 = ~I think it has some protective abilities. I feel somehow... safer when I'm holding it.~
@707 = ~I think it enhances my powers. I feel much stronger when I'm holding it.~
@708 = ~I don't know yet. We'll check it later. I'm quite curious myself.~
@709 = ~That's not your business, Skie. Better go back to formation and let us move on.~
@710 = ~Hmm, that sounds interesting. Perhaps—perhaps I can get used to it.~
@711 = ~...in a while.~
@712 = ~So we know that it's not sucking souls anymore, but we have no idea what else it can do? That's SO reassuring.~
@713 = ~But okay, if you already paid to have fixed it, maybe we could try it out on some enemies? Oh, maybe we should stab some bad goblins and see what happens?~
@714 = ~That way we'll know how it works, right? Come. Let's find some goblins.~
@715 = ~Pff, that wasn't really nice. You were nicer before you held that thing, you know?~
@716 = ~Hey, you know that there's a sea above our heads, right? There's a SEA up there. That's a bit too weird.~
@717 = ~Too weird? Hmm, considering all the troubles I get myself into, I wouldn't call our circumstances "too weird".~
@718 = ~I know. But I have a plan. Just tell me, can you swim? You see, that may be a must.~
@719 = ~We can't stay here any longer, Skie, so less talking, more walking.~
@720 = ~Right. That's actually true.~
@721 = ~Don't even joke like that. I think I saw a really HUGE jellyfish out there. And I'm not sure if you noticed, but we're quite deep. Wouldn't we run out of air and just drown? I'm not sure I even want to think about it.~
@722 = ~Perhaps if we had a huge worm, we could bribe some fishy sentinels. Maybe they would let us pass. And maybe we would find a portal. Or some other... door.~
@723 = ~We'll find our way out of here.~
@724 = ~A huge worm? Hah, well. I must say that I would love to see that, but unfortunately, we have no spare giant worms.~
@725 = ~I'm done with this pointless jabbering. We should get moving.~
@726 = ~I know. It would be really stupid to get stuck here and never catch that creep Irenicus, right?~
@727 = ~I would be surprised if you had any.~
@728 = ~Anyway, I suppose I should stop joking around, right? I bet you'd like to find a way to get us out of here.~
@729 = ~And when we get out, let's hope that wherever we end up, there will be bathtubs. I can smell fish on me. Bleh.~
@730 = ~Eh, fine...~
@731 = ~Hey, you remember what I told Missini? That I'll leave if you're no better than the bandits you were supposed to fight? You just crossed the line. So... I'm leaving. Good luck in whatever nasty things you'll get yourself into.~
@732 = ~That thing you changed into—it woke up because he messed with your soul, right? I felt a similar void before. It's so empty. And creepy.~
@733 = ~And we hoped that we were done with soul-sucking...~
@734 = ~Please, just leave me alone, Skie. I'm not in the mood to talk.~
@735 = ~We thought so, yes. That damn—creep. He came out of nowhere and just started meddling with our lives. First at Dragonspear and now—~
@736 = ~Eh, I'm sorry. He just made me really mad—like literally NO ONE before. But... maybe you need something, <CHARNAME>? You don't look well. I think you have under-eye bags. Maybe you want to rest again? Or eat something?~
@737 = ~I know you want to help. I could use some water, I guess.~
@738 = ~I'm not sure eating can fill that... empty hole inside me.~
@739 = ~I don't need anything from you, Skie. Just get back into formation. I need some space.~
@740 = ~Right! I have some. Here you are. Just—don't be surprised. I put some lemongrass there. I really like it, you know.~
@741 = ~If you like it, too, you can have my waterskin. You deserve nice things after what happened. Even if they can't fix what he did. I wish we could do the same to him.~
@742 = ~I think I know what you're talking about... When my soul was in the dagger, it was like the other way round. I felt as if I was the only non-voidish thing, surrounded by this weird nothingness. Even though we saw this hellish land, it was like... like something fake. As if it wanted to imitate material things like rocks and everything.~
@743 = ~But it failed. I knew that it was just a voidish illusion, not a real place or its creatures.~
@744 = ~Anyway, if you want to talk about Irenicus, that thing inside you, or just anything, you know where to find me. We can also talk about nicer things. I can even try to cook you something when we stop—but that doesn't go well usually. Most of the time.~
@745 = ~Still, I appreciate what you're doing.~
@746 = ~Just give me a break, Skie. I really need some space.~
@747 = ~You're welcome. I really want to help. Oh, and have this. It's a special cream. Put it under your eyes. It should help with those bags.~
@748 = ~Now let's go. Let's find that creep and take back what he took from you.~
@749 = ~Fine... I guess you have the right to be a bit grumpy...~
@750 = ~...and she believed me. Ah, that girl would do anything her sweet Eldoth Kron asked for. But I had to leave anyway. Adventure and, well, other opportunities called.~ [L#2SDE7]
@751 = ~You! YOU!~
@752 = ~What the—~
@753 = ~Ah, what a sight before my eyes! It's Skie Silvershield! Skie the Naive, that's what I used to call her. Boys, meet one of my former bimbos. Skie, meet the boys!~
@754 = ~You pathetic little—from all the stupid people, I had to run into you! What are you doing here? Looking for new harlots? Or maybe you decided to find a company that's even deeper in their cups than you? Only such a group wouldn't be able to realize how stupid you are.~
@755 = ~Could you remind me who that man is?~
@756 = ~Eldoth here? Wait... why am I surprised?~
@757 = ~Scum. I hoped you were dead.~
@758 = ~How could you forget Eldoth? He and I made love under the moonlight and extorted gold from Daddy. Then Eldoth left me for some harlot.~ [L#2SD048]
@759 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME> is here. I'm so pleased to see you again.~
@760 = ~I'm pleased to see you again, too, <CHARNAME>.~
@761 = ~Boys, remember how I told you about a girl who couldn't tell the difference between a dog and a gibberling? That would be this lovely lady right here.~
@762 = ~It's a lie! <CHARNAME> you know it's a lie, right? Oh, you're a damn—dog yourself! A weak one! And stupid!~
@763 = ~Stupid? Girl, you should work on your vocabulary. You called me that a minute ago.~
@764 = ~<CHARNAME>, there's no point in talking to him. He tricked me. He joined your group because he is a leech that wanted someone else to protect him. All he does is feed on other people's goodwill!~
@765 = ~I've had enough of this! I'm sure so have you! Let's give him a piece of what he had coming for a long time... No one is going to help him anyway! Just look at them. They're too drunk. He used to make me feel so insignificant... I want him to feel the same... or even worse...~
@766 = ~Calm down, Skie. You're a good person. I'm telling you this as a friend. You're better than him and you proved it. Together, we saved many people. And a while ago, you join the Flaming Fist because you wanted to help out rather than sit in a palace. Your heart has always been in the right place.~
@767 = ~He's not worth it, Skie. He'll drink himself to death. Remember he's just a pathetic worm that can't get anything done on his own.~
@768 = ~I like that idea, Skie. He's a dead man.~
@769 = ~You're right, <CHARNAME>.~
@770 = ~You're scum, Eldoth, but I am above this. Go away! I don't want to see you EVER again.~
@771 = ~You're weak, Skie. You have always been.~
@772 = ~He's but a scum, <CHARNAME>! He—he's a pathetic fool.~
@773 = ~But you heard your leader, Skie, and you'll listen to <PRO_HIMHER>. You always will.~
@774 = ~Good!~
@775 = ~This tavern has seen enough fighting. Let's take it outside. If you have enough courage to actually face me, fools.~
@776 = ~I—I can't believe we met that... UGH! He ruined my day!~
@777 = ~But that was the right thing to do, right? He was so lucky that you were here and... never mind. Let's just go now, okay?~
@778 = ~I don't understand why you let him go. But fine. I can deal with it. Let's just leave this damn place, okay?~
@779 = ~Come. We should finish this as soon as possible.~
@780 = ~This <DAYNIGHT> can't get any worse.~
@781 = ~My pirate friends, I give you <CHARNAME>—the Hero of Baldur's Gate. Kill <PRO_HIMHER>, and all pirates and thugs will remember your names forever.~
@782 = ~As for you, <CHARNAME>. You must forgive me, but when it's about survival, every trick should be used.~
@783 = ~So, he's dead. I'm not sure if I should be surprised that he was accompanied by those drunken pirates.~
@784 = ~But I suppose he deserved what happened, right? He told people all those lies and did so many nasty things.~
@785 = ~He deserved everything that happened to him, Skie.~
@786 = ~I'm not sure. I mean, it's weird to kill someone you used to travel with.~
@787 = ~I guess you're right. Anyway, let's go now. I think that nothing good ever happens in these docks.~
@788 = ~I know. It's REALLY weird. Anyway, let's go now. I guess that nothing good ever happens in these docks.~
@789 = ~So. Ireni-creep got defeated. Bodhi is dead, for real, not the vampiric way, but somehow the moment you win, something else happens. No wonder you're so fit—you just can't catch a break.~
@790 = ~I wish it wasn't like that. I mean with all those new enemies constantly coming our way, not my fitness.~
@791 = ~Well, at least we're not bored, right? I think I like it in a way—there's always something to do.~
@792 = ~Please, Skie, we have no time to talk about the dead. We should move on, understood?~
@793 = ~Well, like I said, your shape is fine. As for our foes—at least you won't be jobless. If we can count doing our best to survive as a job.~
@794 = ~Someone lives by the rule "boredom-be-gone"! I like that.~
@795 = ~Anyway, I've been thinking about Irenicus. When he kidnapped you, Imoen and others, he kept you in his dungeon, right? That's what I heard. That must have been the place where you found the Soultaker, yes?~
@796 = ~Yes, but I'm not sure what you're getting at with these questions, Skie.~
@797 = ~I don't understand where you're going with these questions, and I don't want to know. Let's just move on.~
@798 = ~Daddy once told me, "it is chance that sometimes makes people do bad things". I wonder if all the evil and weird things Irenicus left behind could become that chance for someone else.~
@799 = ~What if someone finds all those things and picks up his experiments? Not with the Tree of Life, but I bet he had some other "great" ideas written in his books.~
@800 = ~We should hope that the Cowled Wizards secured whatever was there. We can't do everything.~
@801 = ~We can't stop all evil. All his belongings may be used in more than just one way. We can just hope they won't be used to cause more problems.~
@802 = ~It's no longer our problem.~
@803 = ~I don't really care. We should get back to work, Skie. The break is over.~
@804 = ~I guess we can't.~
@805 = ~Well, you're quite an optimist. But that's good. Healthy. Considering our luck and all that.~
@806 = ~Huh, so someone else should think about that? Maybe. Let's hope someone will.~
@807 = ~The point is, I hope no new Ireni-creeps will pop out of nowhere with even weirder plans.~
@808 = ~Well, that would be more than unfortunate. Let's hope it's never going to happen.~
@809 = ~I don't think we need to worry about that, Skie. We should focus on our current problems instead of worrying about the hypothetical ones.~
@810 = ~Even if something like that is going to happen, then we're not retiring yet. We can always stop new threats.~
@811 = ~Eh, I'm tired of talking about matters like that. Let's move on, Skie.~
@812 = ~I suppose you're right. Again. I'll just think about nicer things. Like kittens.~
@813 = ~And that would mean more work. Maybe it's not that bad, but we should also find some time to rest and enjoy things.~
@814 = ~Speaking of nice things, I would kill for a warm bath with bubbles. Like in the elven city. Oh, I already miss that feeling!~
@815 = ~Pff. Fine. If you want to move on so badly, then just lead on.~
@816 = ~You know what? I don't miss the boring life of a noble, but there's something I do miss. I know it's a bit childish to think about it now, in the middle of all these fights and mayhem, but...~
@817 = ~What do you miss, Skie? Maybe I can help you get it?~
@818 = ~I don't really care. We have no time for this. Let us move on, all right?~
@819 = ~I know it's stupid, but I miss chocolate. Ah, the original one, from Maztica. It wasn't the widely exported to Baldur's Gate, but it wasn't impossible to find.~
@820 = ~I know, it's not right to think about chocolate when we're being hunted again and... you know, fighting for our lives. Never mind. Just—just forget I mentioned it, okay?~
@821 = ~But it's fine. We all have those little things we miss or would simply like to enjoy more often.~
@822 = ~I wish I could, but somehow you keep reminding me how childish you are, Skie.~
@823 = ~Really? It's great! Well—not the fact that we miss things or would like to enjoy things we don't have, but it's nice to know I'm not alone.~
@824 = ~I just don't want you to think of me as some spoiled girl anymore. I've changed. At least I hope I've changed. I have, right?~
@825 = ~I don't think of you as a spoiled girl. Not anymore.~
@826 = ~There's nothing wrong about being slightly spoiled.~
@827 = ~It's not your fault that you're like that. That's how you were raised.~
@828 = ~You have. You've learned much. You're more like a heroine now, not that kid who would sneak out of her estate.~
@829 = ~No. And please, stop slowing us down, will you? We really have no time for this.~
@830 = ~You don't? Surely you don't.~
@831 = ~Thanks. It means a lot, <CHARNAME>.~
@832 = ~Maybe. But I just don't want to be seen like that. I did great things! Well, we did, but I helped. Like A LOT.~
@833 = ~But... I suppose it doesn't matter much right now. There are more important things.~
@834 = ~It's about living and doing good stuff About helping and, no matter how boring this sounds, being a tiny bit responsible. Right? Oh, well.~
@835 = ~It's about living the moment. About having fun and traveling to new places, right? And dealing with all those annoying people that constantly want to kill us.~
@836 = ~It would be so much easier if I had some of that Maztican cocoa wonder. But we can't have everything, I suppose.~
@837 = ~That wasn't nice.~
@838 = ~Many people dream of having huge families. That's a tiny bit ironic that family is actually what's causing you so much trouble.~
@839 = ~Well, I suppose my family isn't a typical one.~
@840 = ~I don't think of them as my family. We only share some essence and that's all. When Irenicus stole it, he didn't become my brother.~
@841 = ~That's a bit of a sensitive subject. I don't want to talk about this.~
@842 = ~Well, it's DEFINITELY unusual.~
@843 = ~Well, a fair point.~
@844 = ~But I thought I would ask how you felt about this. That there are people you have something in common with, and they're doing some nasty stuff. And it's not making your lives ANY easier.~
@845 = ~It's hard to feel fine about this.~
@846 = ~It doesn't bother me much. If it wasn't them, other enemies would come.~
@847 = ~You're not making it any easier, Skie.~
@848 = ~Sorry. I think I'm not making you feel better about this, right? I shouldn't have asked. Please, don't go all gloomy because of me, okay?~
@849 = ~I suppose. But, hey, maybe they would be easier to deal with? Anyway, I'm just guessing.~
@850 = ~But not everyone must be evil, right?~
@851 = ~There was Imoen, right? But somehow I'm not sure if mentioning her is a good idea after she died...~
@852 = ~There is Imoen, right? She's nice and helpful. And she doesn't want to kill you.~
@853 = ~And maybe I'm not your sis, but at least you can't say there are no people around who would rather talk than fight!~
@854 = ~Thanks. You know what? You're being so nice that we may actually go shopping soon. Maybe we should look for some well-tailored leather armor for you.~
@855 = ~Heh. I really appreciate the people who work with me. Actually, they feel more like family than my "blood relatives". Or rather "essence relatives", if we want to be more accurate.~
@856 = ~But what if I don't want to talk? Is it so hard to notice that I'm not always in the "talking mood"? Because you seem to constantly bother me with stupid questions or observations.~
@857 = ~Really? Oh, that would be great! But only if we also look for something nice for you. Oh, maybe some enchanted socks that will protect your feet from the cold? That would be something, right? Of course, it would.~
@858 = ~Oh, that was a kinda sweet thing to say! I think we owe you a gift. Like... a pair of nice socks! Maybe enchanted ones that would protect you from the cold? Wouldn't that be a nice gift? Of course, it would.~
@859 = ~Okay, I should have realized that you weren't in the mood.~
@860 = ~Hey, bestie! Have a moment?~
@861 = ~Sure, Skie. What is it?~
@862 = ~No. And I'm not your "bestie".~
@863 = ~You remember that "I'll buy you magic socks" thing I said? It started as a joke, but then I saw these in a shop and I just HAD TO buy them for you. Well, these are shoes. Not only can they make you quicker, but they actually...~
@864 = ~PROTECT FROM COLD! Isn't that a great coincidence? Oh, take them! And wear them with pride!~
@865 = ~Hey, that's so nice of you, Skie! Thanks!~
@866 = ~You shouldn't have... I like my boots, and now I'm not sure what to do.~
@867 = ~I don't need some old shoes. Just take them away, Skie. And by the way—stop calling me your "bestie".~
@868 = ~You're welcome!~
@869 = ~Hey, it's fine. If you don't want to use them, just... keep them as a spare pair. Or let someone else use them.~
@870 = ~They look fabulous and it would be so stupid to leave them in that shop. And I thought it would be a nice gift for you. Now you can do whatever you want with them.~
@871 = ~You deserve what's best, you know.~
@872 = ~That was SO rude...~
@873 = ~I—I can't believe all those people are dead. That Saradush is destroyed.~
@874 = ~We did everything we could.~
@875 = ~Just... let us move on. I don't want to talk about this.~
@876 = ~I know, but... it still feels so weird. Now I understand why Daddy is so afraid when something bad is happening, and he has to fix it somehow.~
@877 = ~It's normal that we feel bad when something like that happens.~
@878 = ~We are all afraid of tragedies like that.~
@879 = ~We didn't know them, so stop acting as if it wasn't Saradush but Baldur's Gate.~
@880 = ~Skie, I really don't want to talk about this.~
@881 = ~Yeah, but...~
@882 = ~I wish we could have done more.~
@883 = ~I think it's a good idea to stop talking for now. I need some time.~
@884 = ~Do you even have a heart?~
@885 = ~I think I don't want to talk to you right now, you know.~
@886 = ~Fine. I... I guess I can understand that.~
@887 = ~My friend over there would like some Maztican chocolate. Do you have any?~
@888 = ~Maztican chocolate? Ah, that's a rare product! But I have one last praline. It's quite expensive... 20 gold pieces. I'm sorry, but it's really hard to get these.~
@889 = ~I'll take it. Serve it to that girl, please.~
@890 = ~I changed my mind. Goodbye.~
@891 = ~Of course.~
@892 = ~My lady? That person over here bought you this Maztican praline. Enjoy!~
@893 = ~<CHARNAME>? Is—is that true? That's SO nice of you! Gods, I really, really, really love this present!~
@894 = ~Here. Take half of it. Go on! You HAVE TO try it. I'm not going to eat my half without you.~
@895 = ~Fine. Let's give it a try. On three. One. Two. Three!~
@896 = ~No. Thank you, but I don't want it. I don't like chocolate.~
@897 = ~No. I want you to have it whole for yourself.~
@898 = ~Hey! I insist!~
@899 = ~You really don't know what you're letting go...~
@900 = ~Mmm. It's amazing!~
@901 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. Moments like that make life much better.~
@902 = ~You know where to find me if you change your mind. Have a good one!~
@903 = ~Skie Silvershield, the thief you met a long time ago, in Baldur's Gate, stands and looks at you. She traveled with you for a very long time, and you saw her change from a whining child to a mature adventurer.~
@904 = ~Skie, you died because of Irenicus before. I don't want this to happen again.~
@905 = ~Are you sure you want to go with me? It may be really dangerous.~
@906 = ~I need you, Skie. I'm not sure if I can do it without you.~
@907 = ~Hey! Don't you believe in me? I'm fine. And I'm going with you. Really. I know it's scary, but—leaving you here would be way too weird.~
@908 = ~I know, but—I came here with you, okay? I'm not going back. Not on my own, so if you're going down there, I'm going with you. It's a bit scary, but I can do it. Really.~
@909 = ~Really? I mean, sure, I'm not going to leave you now. And I know it may be difficult, but we'll get through this. Otherwise, everything we did until now was pointless. So yeah—I'm right behind you.~
@910 = ~Ah, what a classy lady! I must say, my beautiful friend, that this room became much nicer when you came in. It must be your inner radiance that made this place better.~
@911 = ~Hey, that was such a nice thing to say! Wait—you don't know me, and you have no idea who I am, right?~
@912 = ~The only thing I know is that this radiance of yours isn't letting me look at anything else.~
@913 = ~<CHARNAME>, you heard that? I am GLOWING.~
@914 = ~Of course you are, my lady. Perhaps you'd like to sit here with me? I'd love to spend more time with you.~
@915 = ~So maybe you should start with telling me your name?~
@916 = ~I'm Salvanas, my lady. Some may know me thanks to my collection "Darks Shades of Rashemen".~
@917 = ~Wait—the "Dark Shades of Rashemen" collection was designed by Amber Casstel. Nightal 1366 DR, if I'm correct.~
@918 = ~Ah... yes. That... that was me! Amber Casstel is my... alias.~
@919 = ~She was a woman. And she died a few months ago. She was murdered. Are you a dead woman?~
@920 = ~...I think I hear someone calling me. Through magic. Gotta take this! Bye!~
@921 = ~Pff! If you want to lie, at least know the subject you're lying about, Salvanas.~
@922 = ~Hmm, have we met before, m'lady? You look familiar.~
@923 = ~Garrick?! Is that you? Oh, you changed so much—have you been working out?~
@924 = ~Excuse me... Are you that—no, it's impossible. Perhaps you are some... ghosts of the past I barely remember. A beautiful past, yet... a past.~
@925 = ~Hey—what?~
@926 = ~I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy now... My Lady Irlana—she needs my attention.~
@927 = ~I think something, or someone, hit his head, <CHARNAME>. Or he doesn't want to remember us... A pity...~
@928 = ~Do you have anything to say about Skie?~
@929 = ~Ah, Skie Silvershield! Of course, I have something to say about her!~
@930 = ~Where is it—ah! Here! Skie Silvershield, once just a noble girl, now a noble and brave companion of <CHARNAME>, the Hero of Baldur's Gate. A woman of impeccable style and a strong heart that does not only beat for fashion, but also adventure.~
@931 = ~Hey, that was really nice! Thank you, mister Volo!~
@932 = ~Wait—is that Faldorn? THAT Faldorn? The crazy druid with nails that SCREAMED for some care and attention? Well, good luck talking to her, <CHARNAME>. She looks as if she lost her mind entirely.~
@933 = ~It's weird to know that we won't hear that wrinkled gnome again...~
@934 = ~I would never expect to say it, but it's good to see him alive.~
@935 = ~Well, I guess he lost his mind completely. I'm not surprised. Not surprised at all.~
@936 = ~Well... if we're lucky enough, he will fall along with Irenicus.~
@937 = ~Huh, perhaps he will actually help us after all. He did help us once... in a way...~
@938 = ~Isn't that the mage from the Werewolf Island we unluckily visited? Hey, that would explain the "dog talk", right?~
@939 = ~I'm not sure if I should be worried or entertained, you know.~
@940 = ~I'm starting to feel a bit sorry for him...~
@941 = ~Is—is that Imoen? Gods, what happened to her?~
@942 = ~Oh, no... HIM again? Lucky us. I guess everyone you have ever met is coming back to life, <CHARNAME>. Is that your Bhaalspawn power or something?~
@943 = ~Hey, that's really her! We can't leave her like that. She helped you and even joined the fight against the crusade!~
@944 = ~Maybe that's not a bad idea, <CHARNAME>.~
@945 = ~Oh, it's that weird necromancer. We've met him before, right?~
@946 = ~Those shadows are locking halflings in their cells? How much creepier can it get?~
@947 = ~Okay, you're calling her a beast? Shouldn't it be the other way round?~
@948 = ~Oh no—don't tell me he did this again...~
@949 = ~Skie... is that you? So <PRO_HESHE> must have found a way to save you...~
@950 = ~And yes. I'm afraid that... you're right. He may have done it. Again. Just differently. Without... without the Soultaker.~
@951 = ~Did she just—it's all getting weirder and weirder, <CHARNAME>.~
@952 = ~<CHARNAME>, I—I like my eyes, and I'm NOT getting rid of them. Do you understand? I am NOT doing this.~
@953 = ~Right. It would be too easy if we got what we paid for, right? This reminds me of some—fake discount or something.~
@954 = ~Gods, who even starts conversations like that?~
@955 = ~Don't tell me that this is...~
@956 = ~I can see you brought that incompetent girl with you. Shouldn't you be dead, foolish girl?~
@957 = ~No matter. I'm waiting for your leader to give me <PRO_HISHER> answer. So? Do you remember me now?~
@958 = ~You soul-sucking... creep! How can he be proud of this, <CHARNAME>? You changed into that thing because of him and that—thing he did.~
@959 = ~You do not even understand the matters you're speaking of, foolish girl, do you?~
@960 = ~This is just so stupid—Irenicus. We won't let you win. Not again. We're done being puppets in your soul-sucking play. We're fed up with it. Everyone is.~
@961 = ~Ever pathetic girl. You were never a true element of this "play", as you call it. Just a replaceable tool. If you want to die, I will make that happen. And this time, for good.~
@962 = ~This is just so stupid—Irenicus, we won't let you win. Not again. We're done being puppets in your soul-sucking play. We're fed up with it. Everyone is.~
@963 = ~Ever pathetic girl. You were never a true element of this - how you call it—play. Just a replaceable tool. If you want to die, I can make that happen. And this time, for good.~
@964 = ~Well, you surely know how to shine at meetings. I mean—you are the most splendid creature I've ever seen. And quite... radiant.~
@965 = ~But we'll fix it! Somehow. Right? Of course, we will. <CHARNAME>?~
@966 = ~The more dragons we meet, the more I think they are the ultimate mood-killers, <CHARNAME>.~
@967 = ~<CHARNAME>, those guys are being REALLY disgusting.~
@968 = ~You're so stupid I'm surprised you have ANY job at all.~
@969 = ~I won't allow it, <CHARNAME>. Look at this woman? You're really gonna leave it like that?~
@970 = ~Hey! Idiots! Why don't you talk to someone smarter than you? Someone who can teach you PROPER manners!~
@971 = ~I never thought I would say such a thing, but I LOVE this beholder. He has greater charisma than most men we've met!~
@972 = ~It's such a weird decision to make. But you know what to do, right? You always do.~
@973 = ~Ugh... can anyone tell me why this place smells like rotten eggs? I'm going to have to wash my hair at least five times to get rid of this stench.~
@974 = ~Is it gone...? Please, please, please don't do that again...~
@975 = ~You still bear a scar from the time you were hurt. But your wound will not stop you. You will continue your adventures, and you will be remembered for what you truly are.~
@976 = ~Really? I wasn't sure if you really were reading my aura or just admiring my nails. I just polished them, you know. But thanks for the good omen!~
@977 = ~You are most welcome.~

//NEW

@978 = ~It's WAY to high for me in here. My head's spinning... Ugh...~
