@0    = ~Wait—did you see that guy? The one in the plate armor! He used to work with Daddy, but... he should be dead. He was sent on a mission with my brother, they were supposed to work with Kagain...~
@1    = ~It's weird. Like really weird, so... we should check it out. Maybe he'll know how my brother died. We never learned the details of that... disastrous caravan work.~
@2    = ~Fine. Let's follow him. I think he walked down to one of the platforms by the water.~
@3    = ~Do we really need to do this? There are more important matters waiting for us.~
@4    = ~Great! Let's go and see what this is all about.~
@5    = ~It's... either that or I'll go. Seriously, my BROTHER died protecting that caravan and that guy may know something. I'm not letting this chance slip away.~
@6    = ~Fine... I think he walked down to one of the platforms by the water.~
@7    = ~Sorry, but no, Skie. We don't have time for this.~
@8    = ~Ugh! Suit yourself then.~
@9    = ~What is the meaning of—Skie? Skie Silvershield? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!~
@10   = ~I saw you... Uhm... mister!~
@11   = ~...Vully. Vully Grip. Is it really that hard to make you show a man like me at least SOME respect and remember my name?!~
@12   = ~I do respect people! Those that don't pretend to be dead! What are you doing here? How are you even alive? For all I knew, you died in that caravan...~
@13   = ~Hah! No, not really. As you can see, I am very much alive. I thought you came here because of your brother's auction—~
@14   = ~Wait... what?! My brother's auction?! What are you talking about?! Speak or... or... I'll do something nasty!~
@15   = ~You didn't know? Hahaha!~
@16   = ~Well, it looks like this day will be full of surprises for you. Your brother isn't dead either. Well, not yet.~
@17   = ~Where is he?! What did you do?! And... gods, just speak. Now. Please.~
@18   = ~Fine! Know my good heart, girl. When the caravan was attacked, the bandits killed most of us, and your brother and I were the last ones standing. We couldn't win this, but your idealistic and foolish brother wanted us to fight. I gave up, though, I'm not stupid. I offered to join the bandits. They agreed but wanted to test my loyalty first. So I sold your brother—told them who he was.~
@19   = ~We took his clothes, put them on one of the killed men, made sure he'd be beyond recognition. And I guess it worked. Kagain took him for your brother. Yet Eddard was our prisoner, we wanted to demand ransom for his return. Your desperate father would have paid thousands to get his son back. But my new leader decided it was too risky, as the entire Flaming Fist would have been chasing us. So we changed our plan.~
@20   = ~What did you do? SPEAK!~
@21   = ~We used him as a slave. A worker. And when he finally learned his place, got stronger, we knew it was a good time to sell him. Many would pay good money for a young, strong slave. And already tamed. And we finally found a buyer.~
@22   = ~I... I can't believe it. You are a monster! And a creep! He's not some... item that can be sold just like that! Tell me where he is, now! Or else...~
@23   = ~Or else what? You'll throw a tantrum and tell your papa on me?~
@24   = ~No, I will talk to the Hero of Baldur's Gate. Would you mind saying hello to this... smelly brute, <CHARNAME>?~
@25   = ~Hello.~
@26   = ~Skie, please...~
@27   = ~As you may have heard, <CHARNAME> killed Sarevok. Destroyed the Iron Throne. Stopped Caelar's crusade. And <PRO_HESHE> saved me. Well, you might not have heard about the last part as it happened rather recently, but you REALLY don't want to mess with <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@28   = ~The Hero of... oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit. I know what you do to people like me. You... you won't take me alive!~
@29   = ~Doofus! I... would have let him go, I just wanted to know what happened to Eddard. I am really sorry for this mess, <CHARNAME>, I truly am! But... there must be some clues on my brother's whereabouts. I... can't believe he's alive.~
@30   = ~Let's look around.~
@31   = ~Less talking, more searching, Skie. Unless you changed your mind and want to give up on Eddard already.~
@32   = ~Yes, let's check everything. I would even gut a fish if I had to. And that would normally make me throw up. Anyway, let's look. There must be something...~
@33   = ~Of course I'm not giving up! Stop being so rude! Let's look for those clues already.~
@34   = ~It looks like we've got something! And... let me read this horrible, smelly note. Gods, I'm doing this for you, Eddard.~
@35   = ~Blah, blah, blah... "...I'll be waiting behind your house." Does this mean... the person who wrote this is behind THIS house?~
@36   = ~At least we won't have to track that... someone down. And he—or she will probably know where to go next. Wait! I actually noticed some space underneath the stairs behind this shack. Maybe we should check it out?~
@37   = ~Let's see if that someone is still there. Or already there. Or... just let's go. Please, we need to hurry.~
@38   = ~Hmm? You're not Vully.~
@39   = ~No. This is <CHARNAME> and I'm Skie Silvershield. Do you recognize this name?~
@40   = ~Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.~
@41   = ~Enough of that... poo-talk! I've heard it already, and I know my brother is alive, so don't make it too hard, please, and just tell us where he is. I... I can even pay you. Here, take my bracelet and this bottle of perfume. It wasn't used yet and... I really need to know everything.~
@42   = ~Okay, okay. I don't want any trouble, either.~
@43   = ~I heard they found a buyer interested in your brother. A man from Calimshan, a really bad guy, who... well, collects handsome guys as if they were some kind of furniture. They're supposed to meet in the docks, on the hanging platforms, a place people rarely go to. You can get there from the roofs.~
@44   = ~Finally, someone is cooperating. You can go.~
@45   = ~We know where to go next. Come with me, <CHARNAME>, I... kinda need you. They may be armed. Well, obviously they're gonna be armed. Only armed and ugly people deal with slavers, but... that's not the point.~
@46   = ~We won't get a second chance. And it's urgent. That's why I need you. You helped me. You can now help my brother, too.~
@47   = ~Of course. Let's go. Quickly.~
@48   = ~I don't have time for such things, girl. Sorry, you're on your own.~
@49   = ~Thank you! Thank you so much! Now, let's find those platforms. The sooner, the better.~
@50   = ~You throw away my brother's life just like that?! Sorry, but... I can't work with someone like that. You're even worse than Eldoth.~
@51   = ~...this is my final offer.~
@52   = ~Look, he's a strong man. And still young. He will be able to guard you and, I daresay, he can be turned into a skilled assassin. See that pretty face? Everyone's going to trust him. And then, he'll strike the deadliest blow.~
@53   = ~Fine, I can add a few diamonds. Do we have a deal?~
@54   = ~Yes. I suppose we do.~
@55   = ~Okay, this is getting way too creepy! You're not turning my brother into some assassin! Or a slave. Or a servant. Or anything else!~
@56   = ~What is the meaning of this?!~
@57   = ~Everybody stay calm. Let's see what it's all about.~
@58   = ~You there! Why in the Nine Hells are you disturbing our negotiations?!~
@59   = ~Because you're slavers. And I am known for stopping deals like the one you're trying to make here!~
@60   = ~Me? Oh, I'm just with her. Meet Skie Silvershield. The sister of the one you're trying to sell.~
@61   = ~Ah, I should have guessed.~
@62   = ~Sister?~
@63   = ~Look, I'm not as brave as some and... I do not throw myself into brawls, but these last few hours made me SO furious. And I think you are creepy and need to be stopped!~
@64   = ~Eh, this was supposed to be a simple day, finished with a fine meal as a reward for all the hard work. But no, you had to show up and meddle. I'm done talking. Let's get rid of these fools.~
@65   = ~Eddard! It's me! Let me ungag you. These weirdos really made it all so... uncomfortable!~
@66   = ~Argh... thank you... but... Skie? Is that really you, sister?~
@67   = ~Sure it's me! Gods, they didn't even let you wash yourself, hmm? You're... sweaty, but... I'm so happy to see you! We thought you were dead! The caravan—everyone was killed and...~
@68   = ~Not everyone. Vully and I made it alive... He betrayed me and joined them. After the slaughter, he decided to sell me out to the bandits!~
@69   = ~When they realized who I was, they told Vully to disarm me. They took everything I had and... treated me like an animal!~
@70   = ~It looks like we all had a HORRIBLE year. I got murdered, by the way. But <CHARNAME> saved me. And now <PRO_HESHE> helped me save you.~
@71   = ~<CHARNAME>, this is Eddard. Eddard, this is <CHARNAME>.~
@72   = ~I'm happy to meet you. I wish it happened over a table filled with all sorts of food, but... well... Instead of a table, we have these bloody platforms. And instead of food we have... well, this.~
@73   = ~It could be worse. Anyway, pleased to meet you, Eddard.~
@74   = ~Ugh, this is going to leave a bruise. I hope you're worth all that effort, boy.~
@75   = ~Just look at you!~
@76   = ~Of course he is! And... isn't saving people like our job or something? Come on, be nicer!~
@77   = ~Honestly, I'm not sure if I've ever been so angry, and... it all made me feel weird. But at least you're okay.~
@78   = ~<CHARNAME>, let's give Eddard something to wear and... he must come with us! He's quite strong and he knows many maneuvers. I'm sorry, but it's either both of us in the party, or... or we'll have to go north. I can't let us be separated again.~
@79   = ~If I can be honest with you, I'd rather stay and... we can have so much fun together! We can talk, and Eddard can cook us something! He's good at it and... and come on. Please?~
@80   = ~If Skie trusts you, I... suppose I could join you. I will just need to send a letter to my father, but I can do it when we take a break. It's important though, he needs to know I'm not dead.~
@81   = ~Fine, you can join me.~
@82   = ~Skie, he's tired, he almost got sold, and he needs to rest. Let's send him to Waukeen's Promenade, there are few calm taverns there. We'll get back to pick him up when he's rested. Until then, he should have some sleep and something to eat.~
@83   = ~Sorry, but no.~
@84   = ~You heard that? <CHARNAME> said yes and... Oh, I'm happier than ever!~
@85   = ~Calm down, Skie, we wouldn't want you to fall into that water.~
@86   = ~You should know that I'm trying to rescue my friend, Imoen. She was captured by the Cowled Wizards, along with the man who hurt your sister. Irenicus.~
@87   = ~You need to know something. I'm on a mission right now. I need to get even with this insane mage who kidnapped me. Tortured me. I am not to be trifled with, and Irenicus is yet to learn that.~
@88   = ~Fine, let's go.~
@89   = ~Erm... brother?~
@90   = ~I could use some proper sleep and... I would stick to what your friend decides. We can't just make <PRO_HIMHER> change everything in an instance. I'm fine with this suggestion.~
@91   = ~Fine! Fine... but... be careful, Eddard, please. Okay?~
@92   = ~Sure thing, sis.~
@93   = ~I'll be at this... Promenade if you need me. I'll find my way. And... thank you. Both of you.~
@94   = ~Well, it sounds like a complex matter and... if that Irenicus is so dangerous, we should make sure he's not going to hurt anyone else.~
@95   = ~Come now. Before we all catch a cold or something. And Skie... give me a moment. We'll talk again soon. I just need a moment to catch my breath.~
@96   = ~Right. And Skie... give me a moment. We'll talk again soon. I just need a moment to catch my breath.~
@97   = ~Seriously? Gods, I thought you were better than that! Come, Eddard! We're leaving!~
@98   = ~Ah, hello again, friend!~
@99   = ~And hello to you, sister.~
@100  = ~Hi! Oh, you look so much better now!~
@101  = ~I trust you're doing fine? I've already sent my letter to my father. And... it looks like I'm getting my strength back! Hah!~
@102  = ~Would you like to join me?~
@103  = ~I'm glad you're feeling better. And that you're free. Anyway, I need to go now.~
@104  = ~That's... not a bad idea. I like this place, but I already tried most of their ales and got myself cleaned up. Perhaps it's time to get back on the road!~
@105  = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I am SO grateful that you helped me reunite with Eddard. It looks like you're one of the kindest people I've EVER worked with. Garrick wanted to be such a person, but you're way ahead of him. After what you did, I feel I should name some perfume after you. "<CHARNAME>'s Musk" or something. If I ever make perfume for someone like you, an adventurous <PRO_MALEWOMAN> with a soft spot for solving difficult situations!~
@106  = ~So... yeah. Thank you. Really. It looks like you've developed a new habit—helping the Silvershields.~
@107  = ~You're welcome, Skie.~
@108  = ~Anyone with a heart would do the same, Skie.~
@109  = ~I helped him because I would help anyone in such a situation.~
@110  = ~I did it only because I had a moment to spare. Don't get overly excited.~
@111  = ~Huh, you're SO nice! It's a rare quality, judging by all these jobs and requests we get every single day.~
@112  = ~Well, no matter what your reasons were, you helped. Greatly. And I'm grateful for that.~
@113  = ~You know, I've dealt with many people and... I've met those guys and ladies Daddy works with... They can be so moody or demanding, or have all these weird conditions before they even lift a finger. You, however, just did it. Like that. As if it was making some kind of... easy pie!~
@114  = ~Okay, I'm not sure if that's a good comparison, but I didn't need to use any tricks, it was enough that I talked to you, so... you get me.~
@115  = ~It's fine, Skie. It really is.~
@116  = ~Who would ever say no to you, Skie?~
@117  = ~That's all very nice, but let us move on. Please.~
@118  = ~Many people! That I am sure of!~
@119  = ~I just thought you should know that I will remember what you did. I don't know what would have to happen to make me forget. Some weird experiments, maybe, but it's not like we're gonna let such bad things happen anyway.~
@120  = ~Right. I just thought you should know that I will remember what you did.~
@121  = ~You... just let him die like that?! Argh! You are the worst! You are a horrible, HORRIBLE person! Don't expect us to be friends anymore!~
@122  = ~Gods, my... head. I feel... strange. Cold, but... as if my flesh was trying to warm itself up...~
@123  = ~Eddard!~
@124  = ~Skie...? I... I'm glad to see you, but...~
@125  = ~What happened to me, <CHARNAME>...?~
@126  = ~Eddard, you're back! I'm so happy! You were captured by Bodhi... She turned you into one of them, but... I managed to undo the change.~
@127  = ~Hmm, well, it's a weird story, but... you became a vampire. A handsome one, but still, quite undead. I had to conduct this ritual and... it looks like it worked.~
@128  = ~Wait, wait, wait. I... was turned into a vampire?! By all the gods...~
@129  = ~I was so worried! I... I thought I lost you again! Gods, my head. WAY too many emotions at once! Seriously!~
@130  = ~I don't remember what happened. I can recall we went to the cemetery, the Graveyard District, and... that we were approached by some... children of the night...? Bodhi...? Is that what happened?~
@131  = ~Yes. Then, they took you and Bodhi changed you. We had to fight, but I managed to fix everything. But I was so scared.~
@132  = ~More or less, yes. She was prepared and took you away from me. She cursed you with undeath. Vampirism. But it's fine now. You're back to normal.~
@133  = ~I don't want to get into details, but I saved you. That's what really matters~
@134  = ~That's... a lot of information in just one minute.~
@135  = ~Undeath...? Vampirism? So I truly was... like them? Gods, that's... just wrong.~
@136  = ~I... I'm not sure what to say. So... you had to... reverse all of this. Sorry, I'm still confused.~
@137  = ~Thank you. For everything... for saving me. For not letting me die as a monster, but bringing me here and... making me normal again. I'm glad I fell for someone who doesn't give up easily.~
@138  = ~I feel that I caused you trouble and... I wasn't able to aid you when you needed it the most. I wanted to be the one to help, be there, support you, but instead, you had to take care of me. Argh! It's... embarrassing.~
@139  = ~It's not. We couldn't have known she'd play such a card.~
@140  = ~Stop saying such things, Eddard. We know about my heritage and that things like that happen when I'm around.~
@141  = ~Maybe... but who cares? You're alive, and that's the important part.~
@142  = ~I've read so many books. Horror novels. Dark stories. And I was taught about creatures like that... I should have known she may want to use such a trick. Hit where it would hurt the most.~
@143  = ~But... I'm not going to dwell on this. My pride isn't important. What truly matters is that you won. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. You wouldn't bring me back, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. And that makes my heart grow bigger and... happier.~
@144  = ~Would you like to take me back? I may still be of use and... I want to be by your side. You are my <CHARNAME>, after all.~
@145  = ~Of course. Welcome back.~
@146  = ~Sorry, but I don't need you anymore. I just wanted to bring you back to life, but now... we should part ways.~
@147  = ~Thank you. (smile)~
@148  = ~I will do everything in my power to be better. To truly support you. Come now. Let's get Irenicus and be done with him.~
@149  = ~So that's how it ends...? Just... Just like that...? I must have truly failed you...~
@150  = ~<CHARNAME>? Is something wrong?~
@151  = ~No! Come one! Let's keep him! He's doing SO great!~
@152  = ~Do you want me to leave?~
@153  = ~Sorry, but yes. I'll come back here if I need you again, Eddard.~
@154  = ~Sorry, but yes, Eddard. Go to the Copper Coronet, I'll meet you there.~
@155  = ~No, stay. I still need you.~
@156  = ~<CHARNAME>? I thought we liked spending time together. That we were a good team...~
@157  = ~Things change, Eddard, and... I don't need you anymore. Sorry. Wait here, I may come back for you, but for now, that's it.~
@158  = ~Things change, Eddard, and... I don't need you anymore. Sorry... Go to the Copper Coronet, I'll meet you there if I require your help again. But until then...~
@159  = ~No, stay. It's some kind of mistake, Eddard. I need you here.~
@160  = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>. Do you need me again?~
@161  = ~Yes. Welcome back, Eddard.~
@162  = ~No, sorry, but no.~
@163  = ~Agh! Well... I was in the middle of something... I bought this wonderful horror romance, freshly published, and the specter was just about to attack the protagonist. Eh, but I suppose you called me here for a different reason than finding out more about that novel. It's titled "The Spellbiter", by the way. By Inu Hananeko.~
@164  = ~Hi, Eddard! A pity you didn't take that book with you...~
@165  = ~A pity indeed.~
@166  = ~So, why am I here?~
@167  = ~I need your help again, Eddard. Will you join me, please?~
@168  = ~I summoned you by accident. Sorry, but could you stand over there and wait until I really need you?~
@169  = ~I suppose I can join you. (wink)~
@170  = ~It's good I had a little workout yesterday, after a long break. Perhaps some part of me knew we'd join forces again to fight against some evil or insane power.~
@171  = ~You'll tell me all the details on our way.~
@172  = ~A bizarre request, but... fine. I'll stand over there.~
@173  = ~Ah, you're back.~
@174  = ~Sorry, but yes, Eddard. Go to the Pocket Plane, I'll meet you there.~
@175  = ~Things change, Eddard, and... I don't need you anymore. Sorry... Go to the Pocket Plane, I'll meet you there if I need you again. But until then...~
@176  = ~You know, it feels weird, because we were all convinced you were dead. When the caravan was found, it was like... you know... finding your tombstone!~
@177  = ~And then you're suddenly here. Even looking like the old Eddard. Not too many scars. Still the same guy who broke Boernalla's heart.~
@178  = ~Oh, right, Boernalla... I thought you'd forget about that. She was never my type, sorry. And believe me, had I been given the chance to inform you I was alive, I would have taken it. I would have let you, father or mother know. But... that really wasn't an option.~
@179  = ~It's... I know. I just feel as if we lost so much time. But—at least you're here now, and I can talk to you. So everything is better. Maybe I just need some time to enjoy your return to the fullest! It's like you suddenly got a chest full of new clothes and wanted to try them all at once.~
@180  = ~I know what you mean and... believe me, I'm also feeling it. And I'm quite happy I can see my weird sister again!~
@181  = ~Hey! I'm not weird! You're weird!~
@182  = ~Hah, of course, I am. To you, I'll always be weird.~
@183  = ~...and do you remember how we would put lard in father's sponge-cake sandwich, and how weirded out we were when we found out he actually liked it?~
@184  = ~I do, yes. Skie, I haven't lost my memory. I may have been gone for a while, but... everything else is still there, in my mind and heart.~
@185  = ~I'm glad and... it's not like I'm checking you. I'm just flooded with all these memories, and thinking about them now makes me happier.~
@186  = ~For a long while thinking about all those jokes or lessons we had to attend together, it was all kinda painful. I realized that sharing those BORING days at the estate wasn't that bad, because at least we could whine about it together. Or fight with Daddy, so he would let us go out, meet with friends or just do normal stuff.~
@187  = ~And the sad part is that I felt as if it was for nothing. Because it wasn't coming back, ever. But it is back. And these memories feel okay again.~
@188  = ~They are more than just okay, Skie. Those memories helped me fight and survive. Day by day.~
@189  = ~...wait, what did you say?~
@190  = ~I said you become quite strong. Perhaps you even learned some things I wouldn't be able to learn.~
@191  = ~I THINK I may need to hear that one more time.~
@192  = ~Skie...~
@193  = ~Okay, okay. I'm just surprised you noticed, but... I suppose you learned a few tricks, too! I just wish you had mastered them in nicer circumstances, not trying to survive as a slave... That sounds so creepy, even when I say it myself.~
@194  = ~It does. But I must say that it's good to see how much stronger you are right now. Hah! If only father saw you today!~
@195  = ~...and when I was dead, it felt weird. Like too weird. I don't want anyone to feel that way.~
@196  = ~I'm happy you're back and... Whenever you tell me about it or add new details, it gives me chills. Bad chills.~
@197  = ~I know, but I got saved and... it's not happening again.~
@198  = ~Of course. I'm not letting it happen.~
@199  = ~I think you should shave all that facial hair. So you could be like my little brother!~
@200  = ~What next? Should I get rid of all my body hair? Chest, armpits, legs? Should I also make myself a wooden sword? Hah, sorry, Skie, but I'm fine in my current body. And my sideburns, mustache, and beard—they're staying.~
@201  = ~Eh, a pity...~
@202  = ~Unless...~
@203  = ~Unless what?~
@204  = ~Unless I shave them off when you're sleeping.~
@205  = ~Skie... you're being creepy.~
@206  = ~I'm just joking! That would be way too weird!~
@207  = ~But maybe <CHARNAME> will convince you to do that, at some point!~
@208  = ~I hope <CHARNAME> likes how I look now.~
@209  = ~Anyway, I guess we should move on.~
@210  = ~...and what happened next?!~
@211  = ~The woman from the old house entered the room and said the child was long dead and all the time they were in the house, they were only feeding an illusion. A memory of the long-lost treasure that would never be theirs again. That's how chapter eleven ends.~
@212  = ~Oh, I have goosebumps!~
@213  = ~What are you two doing?~
@214  = ~Uhm, am I interrupting something?~
@215  = ~What kind of morbid story is that...?! Do you want her to have nightmares again?~
@216  = ~Heh, Skie likes it when I tell her the stories I read.~
@217  = ~He's a fine storyteller, and some books can be so heavy... I wouldn't take them on long trips! So I usually ask him to tell me those stories!~
@218  = ~That's more or less how it is.~
@219  = ~Okay, go on, you weirdos.~
@220  = ~A pity you didn't invite me, I could listen to that, too.~
@221  = ~I see. I won't interrupt your brother-and-sister time, then.~
@222  = ~Well, if we are weirdos, then you are the LEADER OF WEIRDOS. You should think about that.~
@223  = ~Hah. Perhaps next time! But... I suppose we could do that, yes.~
@224  = ~It's not like you're interrupting, it's just something we've been doing since we were kids. Anyway, you can join us some other time.~
@225  = ~You know, I must say that I'm kinda happy that you and <CHARNAME> are together. I think <PRO_HESHE> is far from boring, and that's good.~
@226  = ~Heh, we'll <PRO_HESHE> is certainly interesting and... good-looking. But also quite skilled, and I think I like <PRO_HIMHER> just as <PRO_HESHE> is.~
@227  = ~Seriously, I wish the two of you well. I suppose when you have someone like that, it's easier to become better, right? Of course, I'm right.~
@228  = ~This time you certainly are.~
@229  = ~So, is <PRO_HESHE> a good kisser?~
@230  = ~Skie, come on! I'm not going to tell you that. It's between me and <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@231  = ~You can be SO boring sometimes! It's not like I want to steal your cuddly beloved one from you, Eddard. Haha. And I guess the important thing is that you like it.~
@232  = ~I DO like it.~
@233  = ~Good, and... about his...~
@234  = ~SKIE! NO!~
@235  = ~...hair. I was going to ask you about his hair and—wait... you thought I'd ask about... EWWW! You pervert!~
@236  = ~This is getting... awkward.~
@237  = ~Well, you made it awkward, brother!~
@238  = ~You know what? Maybe it would be best if we just moved on. Perhaps I should leave some stuff just for the two of you. It will also be to the benefit of my own mind and imagination.~
@239  = ~Why are you looking at me like that, Eddard? Do I have something on my face?~
@240  = ~Sis, I think you got some muscles because of all that adventuring. Soon, your jacket may be too small for you.~
@241  = ~What? No, no, no, no. That's not gonna happen! And... I knew I may get a bit stronger, but I'm not going to resign from that jacket. Seriously.~
@242  = ~I'll find a seamstress or... a tailor. And they'll make it work just fine. That's the ONLY option.~
@243  = ~And it's not like I'll get much bigger. Perhaps just a bit more... ripped. But a TINY bit.~
@244  = ~Of course, of course. It's not like you're going to eat hundreds of saffron buns.~
@245  = ~Oh, I would eat one... but just ONE. Perhaps we'll find a merchant that sells them.~
@246  = ~...or a demon pretending to be one. They know what we desire most, so be careful.~
@247  = ~Ugh, that would be the WORST disguise ever!~
@248  = ~Oh, it would be great if you could play the guitar for us! I always loved it when you played for me at home.~
@249  = ~Sadly, Skie, I don't have a guitar. And... I think I'd need to practice first! It's been over a year since I played.~
@250  = ~Oh, with all that money we've got we can just buy you a guitar. If you want. Pretty please?~
@251  = ~Heh... perhaps... When we're done with everything that's happening right now, Skie.~
@252  = ~Ugh, another year then...?~
@253  = ~It's kinda sweet when you look like that at <CHARNAME>, you know. I'm not sure I've ever seen you look like that at any other man or woman! Hah!~
@254  = ~Well, it looks like you're back to your old habit of embarrassing me, Skie. Please, at least do it a bit more... quietly?~
@255  = ~Wasn't it you who told me to speak about how I feel openly because that's just who I am?~
@256  = ~Erm...~ 
@257  = ~Exactly. These were your own teachings, brother.~
@258  = ~So... you're happy, right?~
@259  = ~In general? I... think so. Happier than when I was enslaved, that's for sure...~
@260  = ~No, I mean... with <CHARNAME>. I know <PRO_HESHE> is a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but is <PRO_HESHE> treating you well? I mean, it always looks like it, but... How are YOU feeling about this?~
@261  = ~I'm happy. And <CHARNAME> is a wonderful <PRO_MANWOMAN>, yes. I wouldn't be with <PRO_HIMHER> if it wasn't making me happy. I know it doesn't always work out when people fall for each other, but this thing between us is different. It feels right.~
@262  = ~Good, good! But if <PRO_HESHE> hurts you, <PRO_HESHE> will see you can't mess with my brother without getting into trouble with Skie Silvershield.~
@263  = ~...but I hope it's not gonna happen because I REALLY like <PRO_HIMHER> too, so... Let's just assume it's all gonna stay as it is.~
@264  = ~Eddard. Hey, Eddard! Psst!~
@265  = ~What's wrong, Skie?~
@266  = ~I got you some mouthwash.~
@267  = ~Gods, why?~
@268  = ~Because we wouldn't want you to repel <CHARNAME> with something as silly as a morning breath.~
@269  = ~We're fine, REALLY. Skie, come on, I do take care of my teeth, breath, and... everything. And insinuating it's not true is quite mean.~
@270  = ~Okay, just... keep it as an emergency thing, then. Better safe than sorry.~
@271  = ~Aerie, I am truly sorry.~
@272  = ~What for, Eddard...? I think it's the first time we're talking, so... I'm not sure what you're apologizing for.~
@273  = ~The last time we were resting, I... by accident... saw your scars. I apologize for not turning my eyes away, but also... I'm sorry about what happened to you.~
@274  = ~I know the circumstances under which such wounds and scars happen and I wish I was wrong, but I think you suffered greatly. And with no fault of your own.~
@275  = ~I... I did suffer, yes, and... I indeed feel strange knowing you saw my scars. I'd rather pretend they didn't exist and in a situation like this, it becomes... very difficult...~
@276  = ~I know how it feels. I had to deal with ill circumstances and will. And I, too, was hurt.~
@277  = ~Eddard, please, I... I do not doubt it, but as I said: I am not sure how comfortable I am with you seeing those scars... without me knowing it...~
@278  = ~So please, just... leave me be.~
@279  = ~I can't stop thinking about how uncomfortable I made you feel the last time we talked. Perhaps it would have been better if I kept it to myself. I mean, the information that I saw how badly hurt you were...~
@280  = ~Maybe it would have been better, indeed, but... it already happened, Eddard. And... you apologized. So it's only fair to forgive you.~
@281  = ~I suppose I am capable of that. And I am feeling a bit better. I needed time. Just...
 I'd like to have more privacy. Some space so I could... contemplate. Many things.~
@282  = ~Of course, Aerie, that's understandable.~
@283  = ~Thank you.~
@284  = ~You're welcome. But just let me admit that... I'm glad we're better. If there's anything you'd like to talk about, you know where to find me.~
@285  = ~Yes... I suppose I do. Now... excuse me, Eddard. I may need some... alone time.~
@286  = ~I think if I told the old Aerie who she was going to become, she would not have believed me. You're like a heroine writers and bards praise in their tales, and their audience dreams they would become like you one day. They would like to have your strength, dignity, and... respect, I presume.~
@287  = ~You're right... while I wouldn't describe my current self the way you did, I wouldn't have believed you if you had told me I would go that far...~
@288  = ~I... also hope that enough time has passed for you not to be angry about me seeing your scars and... you know what I am speaking of.~
@289  = ~I don't think I was angry. Even if I was, it wasn't exactly about you. It was mostly about how I... could barely think about them. In my mind, they turned into some... evil markers. Mementos of misfortune. I'm not sure if that's understandable...~
@290  = ~It is. It truly is. But the new Aerie I see is stronger. And even if some scars may feel as these mementos, they also show where we came from. How we've changed and how much we care about survival.~
@291  = ~And there's nothing wrong about that.~
@292  = ~Looking at you reminds me what kind of burden a family name can be. That little detail can cause so much pressure.~
@293  = ~I suppose that "Silver Shield" you were forced to hold was never a light one. Even as time passes, there is a chance it won't become easier to bear. No matter how strong your arms will get.~
@294  = ~That's an awfully bitter remark... but perhaps an apt one.~
@295  = ~Names like ours do come with burdens. We are born with them and... well... I guess most of us die with them.~
@296  = ~But... I think we're getting painfully serious here. So perhaps we should stop it before we become like the dead already. Even though we most certainly breathe.~
@297  = ~...that was when my father would bring that Ghaffley guy and I saw him steal our wine and whiskey from the kitchen. Our cook would use them for some pastry and desserts. He just went in there and took them.~
@298  = ~Perhaps he could not resist the urge. I am not trying to make excuses for him, but I saw certain... people who found themselves overwhelmed by this kind of... temptation.~
@299  = ~I... am sure you know what you are talking about, Anomen, but I don't think these things should be allowed to happen.~
@300  = ~Neither do I believe it, Eddard. You may need to trust me on that. But... I think I am done talking about this. We should just... move on.~
@301  = ~Do you remember how we talked about what a burden a family name can be? Our work made me realize it's not just a matter of a name. Just look at how many obstacles <CHARNAME> had to face. Because of <PRO_HISHER> blood, beliefs, companions, or... just because <PRO_HESHE> happened to be in a particular place at a particular time.~
@302  = ~Mmm, that is indeed true, Eddard. Perhaps this is what the world is all about: the fight and its results. <CHARNAME>, I presume, wanted to live. Show who <PRO_HESHE> is and what <PRO_HESHE> is worth.~
@303  = ~I think it's also about making a difference.~
@304  = ~I believe that's what <CHARNAME> has been doing all this time.~
@305  = ~Of course. A difference. Even if we don't always know what it's going to mean for us.~
@306  = ~I think you'd love the Cloakwood area, Cernd. Thanks to <CHARNAME> it didn't end up fully exploited and drained by the Iron Throne.~
@307  = ~They cared mostly about the mines, but if they continued extracting the resources, I think the Cloakwood as a whole would suffer. Even if only because of the carts going to and fro with the iron.~
@308  = ~Where there is a spring, there are creatures that will sip its water, Eddard. However, it is best when they do it out of thirst, not gluttony and greed. Otherwise, many may suffer.~
@309  = ~Yes, I suppose you're right. And that's more or less what <CHARNAME> prevented. This kind of exploit would result in many with people suffering. Or dying.~
@310  = ~Then I am glad it ended. And perhaps I will indeed get my chance to see the Cloakwood with my own eyes.~
@311  = ~Let's hope the Shadow Druids are no longer there. I bet you'd rather avoid them.~
@312  = ~I certainly would.~
@313  = ~I wonder if there are times when people like you, seeing the harm our kind does to each other, would rather change into another creature and remain in its form forever.~
@314  = ~Every element has its place, Eddard, so do people of all races. But... I suppose, yes, there are times when our kind can display truly monstrous tendencies. I wish it wasn't so, but... I'm afraid it will always remain just a dream.~
@315  = ~Mhm. I suppose you're right.~
@316  = ~Luckily, there are sensitive people in this world, too. Those who prove not everyone is the same and not everyone has to bring more pain than hope.~
@317  = ~While I'd like to be such a man, Cernd, it doesn't sound like an easy goal. Perhaps... rather an overwhelming one.~
@318  = ~When you change, Cernd, you're like a different being. You don't even remind me of the calm man I know. That's actually... fascinating!~
@319  = ~Where there is sunlight, there are also shadows, my friend. And where there is a threat, there are those that will try to do something about it. And their means... well, they can take different shapes.~
@320  = ~Quite impressive shapes, as we could see more than once. Also, quite hairy and clawed.~
@321  = ~Heh, well... yes. You're right. Even I had to learn how to get used to it. But the shape I can wear is indeed different from the skin I usually walk in.~
@322  = ~Different is an understatement, Cernd. It's like calling a trident a fork.~
@323  = ~My mother's friend once showed me how to produce flame, but... it looks like you can do more than that, heh.~
@324  = ~Are you truly comparing MY powers to some... parlor tricks and cantrips?! It shows how much you actually know about magic, foolish boy. (It's like comparing a mouse to Kazgaroth.)~
@325  = ~I think I know more than you think. I simply never aspired to be a master arcanist. And I am no sorcerer.~
@326  = ~That is quite clear, yes, and even if you tried, I can tell you wouldn't make a proper mage, boy. You lack certain... potential.~
@327  = ~Real power isn't for everyone. Some may need to satisfy themselves with mere crumbs of magic, while lying to themselves they truly understand something they've barely brushed. (Exactly like you.)~
@328  = ~Maybe. I know some magic, though I never call myself a specialist. But neither will I say I am completely ignorant about it, Edwin.~
@329  = ~Have you ever regretted taking this particular approach to using magic, Edwin?~
@330  = ~Doubts are for those of a weak mind, boy. I, however, focus on what I want to know, and I embrace it. That's what makes me a mage, and what will turn me into an archmage. In time. When I decide the time is right. (And that shall be sooner than you think.)~
@331  = ~Mmm, I suppose it's good you're confident about where you are and where you want to be. That may help to set a specific path to your goal. No matter what it is.~
@332  = ~Hah! I can't believe what I am about to say, but you are correct. I can agree with your assessment.~
@333  = ~While you're obviously not like the bright minds I could talk to in Thay, I... suppose you are not exactly a waste of breath like those simians I have to deal with here, in this part of the world.~
@334  = ~But enough of this chatter! There are matters I still need to focus on. (I won't let talks like this delay the progress I planned for myself.)~
@335  = ~There are times when I think you'd eagerly create a world of your own if you could.~
@336  = ~Perhaps I could, boy, but... there are still secrets in this world that wait for Edwin Odesseiron to uncover. And I'll happily do it. (And then, use what I've learned however I wish.)~
@337  = ~Well, I can certainly relate to that, as... the process of learning may be pleasant. So is uncovering secrets.~
@338  = ~Yes. Indeed. But... you're wasting my time again. Time no one is giving me back, so... do us both a favor, boy, and learn on your now. I am busy. (He's taking way too much of my time.)~
@339  = ~Of course. I won't trouble you again.~
@340  = ~If you were a usual man, I would ask if you learned to fight on a ballet room floor, but I presume, Haer'Dalis, that they don't have such rooms in... wherever you're from.~
@341  = ~Ah, there are many rooms and many doors where I come from, and I wouldn't be surprised to find a ballet room behind one of them, my dear trumpeter swan.~
@342  = ~With so many doors, you can easily get lost and... As surprising as that may be, considering where I grew up, I'd rather have a small house, even a cottage, but know it well. I'd definitely choose it over a place filled with doors and rooms I'd find hard to count.~
@343  = ~Then you should never visit the City of Doors because that's more or less what Sigil is, trumpeter swan. An enormous surprise. An enigma—a puzzle that may be impossible to solve.~
@344  = ~Mmm. Then I will simply trust you that it's not a place for me. I'm wondering what kind of place you think I'd like.~
@345  = ~Hah, well, 'tis a subject I'd need to put into careful consideration before I can give you an answer, Eddard.~
@346  = ~So? Have you made up your mind, Haer'Dalis? Do you know what place you think I'd enjoy?~
@347  = ~Aye, and I think you are exactly in that place right now. Not literally, no, my friend! But what I believe you want is an adventure and an opportunity to learn. And that is what <CHARNAME> provides, am I wrong?~
@348  = ~Heh, I suppose you're not.~
@349  = ~That is indeed what I find... thrilling. Knowing this world. Not just any world, but this one. The one I come from. The Sword Coast. Amn. Perhaps Waterdeep and maybe, just maybe, Neverwinter.~
@350  = ~These are the lands and cities I know and may return to. In their own way, they all affected the world I was growing up in, so... I suppose I should understand them. At least a bit.~
@351  = ~That may be so, trumpeter swan, but perhaps that's what you actually want, not something you should do.~
@352  = ~Mmm. You may be right, Haer'Dalis.~
@353  = ~I must say that since we talked about all those places, my world, and the cultures that shaped it, I've tried to learn more about them... It turns out this knowledge I want to possess is... richer than I thought.~
@354  = ~Ah, Eddard, my trumpeter swan, that means you've made a few steps already, but there is even more information you need to acquire. You're yet to see how different scenarios play out in this world. To gather all that knowledge, it may take years. Five, ten, even twenty or thirty! I suppose it depends on how much you want to know, my friend.~
@355  = ~Are you saying that there may be no limit?~
@356  = ~That's what I am saying, indeed, as this world is not set in stone, Eddard. While you learn, new stories and tales take shape.~
@357  = ~Well... I suppose it's going to take me some time.~
@358  = ~True. True it is.~
@359  = ~I heard that we have a common friend.~
@360  = ~Do we...?~
@361  = ~Liia. Duke Jannath.~
@362  = ~Ah... right. I... am sorry, Eddard, I still find it hard to gather my thoughts sometimes, after everything that happened in our lives in the past year...~
@363  = ~I suppose that's natural, Imoen. A pity, though, that when you were in Baldur's Gate, I wasn't there. Perhaps we would have learned from each other. Exchanged tales.~
@364  = ~Considering that Liia was training you, my father wouldn't have objected to us working together. Maybe he would have even encouraged it.~
@365  = ~Maybe... but I suppose it couldn't have happened... You were... being held captive. And I wasn't just studying. I was attacked and got wounded... And all that time I worried about the crusade and... everything.~
@366  = ~True. Today we can just wonder what it could have been like, but these are just speculations with no real consequences and... never mind.~
@367  = ~I'm still glad, though, that we can work together now.~
@368  = ~...and Liia, believe me, or not, had one glass of wine too many! Haha! She insisted on casting Color Spray to color the ice sculpture this artist prepared, hah! EVERYTHING went wrong. And it was just a Color Spray spell.~
@369  = ~That was the last time I saw her drink more than two glasses of her favorite red. No wonder. She should be happy only my father, mother, Duke Belt, and I were there that evening.~
@370  = ~Hah! Well... I must say, you cheered me up quite a bit! I can't imagine Duke Jannath getting drunk and... trying something like that... with Color Spray. That woman would tell me not to "overuse magical energies as..."~
@371  = ~"...you can never know when you'll need them!" Hah! I know, I know.~
@372  = ~I just hope she's safe now. Perhaps there will be a time when we'll meet again. With her and everyone else...~
@373  = ~...you really think so?~
@374  = ~I do. Your father would be proud of you. You had a part in great feats... and...~
@375  = ~...it's the same with Skie. You are both heroes. I do hope that once again everything will work out... well.~
@376  = ~I really hope so, too! And... thanks, Imoen. It's nice of you to say this.~
@377  = ~It looks like we really changed this world.~
@378  = ~For the better. Mostly. And... I hope it's going to stay that way.~
@379  = ~I heard you knew <CHARNAME>'s foster father. What was he like?~
@380  = ~Gorion? Yes, I knew him. We worked together a couple of times and... there were parts of our lives we didn't disclose to each other, but I can say he was a wise man. And a resourceful one.~
@381  = ~He always had a couple of contingency plans, and he was quite vigilant, too. That's why... finding out he died truly saddened... and surprised me.~
@382  = ~Thank you for telling me. I was wondering who took care of <CHARNAME> and taught <PRO_HIMHER> so much.~
@383  = ~Perhaps... I wouldn't tell everyone what I told you. But... you seem like a good person. Still young, but I'm not surprised you want to know more about <CHARNAME>.~
@384  = ~Mmm. Well... yes. We're working together. And I suppose you can learn a lot about someone by knowing who raised them. I guess. That's what they say.~
@385  = ~Right. Anyway, since you know that already, I think it would be best if we moved on now.~
@386  = ~You know, I've met another Harper before.~
@387  = ~Hmm, it looks like everyone knows about my... affiliation these days. But tell me the name. Perhaps I know that agent.~
@388  = ~Simnick. Simnick Meancock.~
@389  = ~Ah... yes... Simnick. Well, we were never good friends. And somehow I always thought that name suited him very well.~
@390  = ~Hah! I was thinking EXACTLY the same thing.~
@391  = ~He came to my father once, wanting to warn him about an arsonist in Baldur's Gate, but somehow this... Meancock acted as if he was more important than both the arsonist and my father. And... actually, everyone else in the room.~
@392  = ~Yes. That sounds like him.~
@393  = ~You see, the mere fact you belong to the same organization doesn't always mean you share the beliefs or... tact of other members.~
@394  = ~I know many good Harpers. But I suppose there are also those that... are... how to put it... Meancocks.~
@395  = ~It would be nice to see you become someone as important as Elminster. Or Alustriel Silverhand.~
@396  = ~Hah! Well, that's a good one, Eddard!~
@397  = ~I am sorry, but I never aspired to a position of importance. And I doubt I will ever be as old as they are now. I just do what must be done. Help those who need it. I do not plan to become such a power on Toril... Neither have I ever been a Chosen of Mystra candidate. She wouldn't choose me. And maybe that's good.~
@398  = ~You do not need to be one of the Chosen. Or... perhaps you'll be a Chosen of Silvanus. Or Mielikki. Or anyone else. Or just Jaheira. A woman who cares.~
@399  = ~Now you are just coming up with some fantastic stories, Eddard. Well... perhaps one day you will tell them to your son. Or your daughter.~
@400  = ~Perhaps you'll have one with <CHARNAME> one day.~
@401  = ~It is them you should tell such stories to, Master Silvershield. But... thank you. Even if only for amusing me.~
@402  = ~Ah, Eddard! I heard the Silvershield family has some land near Baldur's Gate. I thought that... perhaps when this is over, we should go there together. I could inspect the soil and help you and your family grow some extraordinary plants and vegetables. Anything for a friend. Perhaps... we could even start a business.~
@403  = ~What business?~
@404  = ~If I succeed with you, I'm sure other noble families will want the Jansen "magic". Perhaps we'll be able to invite some of my family members to join us. They are all skilled in some way and I think this undertaking could be a great success.~
@405  = ~Well, Jan, write a business plan, and perhaps we'll talk about this. I... I'm not sure if I'm suited for a farming business, but... maybe one of my friends—~
@406  = ~That is a splendid idea! Yes, of course, I say yes to this, and I'll start working on the document immediately. Actually, I'm very good at preparing such things... Most of the time... And when it doesn't involve dealing with Athkatlan clerks, but this time it really doesn't, so everything should be in order.~
@407  = ~Right... somehow I'm starting to worry about what kind of document I may receive from you.~
@408  = ~I've prepared the document you asked for, Eddard. Here. Just take a look!~
@409  = ~These are... wait—why are there turnips and carrots drawn on almost every page?~
@410  = ~I thought that everyone should understand how serious I am about it... and that all Jansens are serious people. I decided to show my dedication and knowledge of vegetables! You see, it's truly amazing what shapes and sizes they can take. And some, like carrots, can have different colors. Naturally, without any magical enhancements! And—~
@411  = ~Jan, Jan, Jan. Please. I... I'm not sure if I can show this to anyone. Not with all these vegetables! And this carrot looks like—never mind. I... don't think I want to go that way.~
@412  = ~Ah... well, I can try to prepare a new document, but I'll need some time.~
@413  = ~Erm... just... take all the time you need.~
@414  = ~Eddard! Do you still remember that business plan you asked me to do from scratch? I have it ready. And it's BETTER than ever! I'm not lying, it truly is, so... here. I'd like you to take a look at it.~
@415  = ~Jan... I asked you to skip the drawing. And there are even more drawings here. And more... carrots. Even more resembling... things. And—in the Nine Hells, how many pages are there?~
@416  = ~Exactly one thousand, one hundred and seventy-seven pages.~
@417  = ~Jan. You're... insane. This is—it's... like... argh—no one is going to read this...~
@418  = ~Even you? I worked on it so hard. I... I almost broke my wrist. Just... trust me, it's a really good document, and I'd love for you to take a look at it. Even if I need to make it shorter, perhaps we can cut out a few pages. Like twenty perhaps?~
@419  = ~I...~
@420  = ~...I mean...~
@421  = ~...~
@422  = ~Gods...~
@423  = ~What did I get myself into...~
@424  = ~I must say that I envy that beard of yours. Mine looks poorly compared to yours. I  may never grow what you have.~
@425  = ~Well, my boy, it's not that important. I know some young men like you would like to have a beard, but not everyone has one, and it doesn't mean there's something wrong with your face.~
@426  = ~I was told it's all in the flesh and skin and some just can't grow it, but they still can be strong. Virtuous. And they can make other men marvel at their achievements.~
@427  = ~I... I know that, Keldorn, but you probably also know that there are situations in which appearance matters. I believe that men with beards like yours are often considered more experienced and capable.~
@428  = ~Perhaps. But those truly clever know facial hair has nothing to do with skills and capability.~
@429  = ~Besides, you do not need to prove to anyone you are "manly" enough. And we trained together. I know you are strong and that you have the body of a fine fighter. You have no reason to be worried about who you are.~
@430  = ~I know and... I've been told that I'm handsome, but still, some people see a boy in me, not a man.~
@431  = ~You are a man, Eddard. And I am sorry for calling you a boy before.~
@432  = ~It's fine. I suppose you're right. I am a grown man, and I've earned my place in this team.~
@433  = ~You have earned it, yes. I am sure <CHARNAME> would say the same.~
@434  = ~About our last conversation... I think I'd like it to stay just between us, Keldorn. I realized that it could make people think I have some... unresolved issues.~
@435  = ~It was a talk between gentlemen. We all have the right to have some doubts and questions, Eddard. You are not different. And if you think I never had doubts about what kind of man I am, then you are wrong.~
@436  = ~I once met Lady Isyna, a warrioress... most likely stronger than me. She too felt she could be better. Or she was afraid people would think she was not wise enough to serve the Church of Oghma. But she was wrong. She was, and hopefully is, exactly the person she needed to be.~
@437  = ~And you are exactly the man you are supposed to be. Strong. Vigorous. Clever. And let me say, handsome. You will be just fine. You already are.~
@438  = ~Thank you again, Keldorn.~
@439  = ~You are welcome, Master Silvershield. And do not worry, everything we discussed shall stay between us.~
@440  = ~You're hurt, Master Firecam...~
@441  = ~Heh. Yes. Not for the first time and probably not for the last. Thank you, though, for helping me in that last battle. Sometimes I feel you're getting stronger than me. And quicker.~
@442  = ~You're just saying that because of what we talked about a long time ago.~
@443  = ~No. I am saying it because I can see that you became an even more skilled man. A person of many talents. It's good to know that once I slow down, other valiant warriors will be there to fight for Toril's men and women.~
@444  = ~That won't be necessary for a very long time.~
@445  = ~Haha, of course. But still, it's good to know.~
@446  = ~Ye be holdin' tha weapon o' yers like it be ye cock, no yer weapon! Ye need t' swin' it, an' all ye do be wiggle it!~
@447  = ~I do NOT wiggle it and I know how to fight, Korgan. I've been practicing for years now.~
@448  = ~Ye may be practicin', aye, bu' ye still need t' kill a few goblins o' gnolls t' know how t' properly swin' ye thin'! Har har har!~
@449  = ~Now, I'm not sure if you're referring to—you know, never mind.~
@450  = ~I don't want to know.~
@451  = ~I'm sorry to say that, but there are a few things about you that remind me of Kagain. If he paid his men and women more, perhaps things would go more fortunately for me...~
@452  = ~Har har! Ye are now blamin' Battleaxe fer crimes I would probably do, bu' ne'er did? Har! Nae, go an' cry under a different tree... this wood not be carryin' wha' happened t' ye.~
@453  = ~Of course, you don't. And fine, I shouldn't bother you. It's not like it's my hobby anyway. I'll better go and do some push-ups.~
@454  = ~There are times when I think you just want to kill our enemies with your body odor...~
@455  = ~Ye may think ye be funny, boy, bu' ye be jealous o' me swingin' me axe left an' right!~
@456  = ~It be months since I told ye 'bout tha' wigglin' o' yers and I see no improvement! Har har!~
@457  = ~Eh, never mind. You know, just... kill our enemies any way you want. Axe, breath, crotch fumes... you pick it.~
@458  = ~Gods, if you were there with that bow of yours during the little archery matchups between me and Skie, you would have beaten us both. Your archery skills are beyond compare, miss Mazzy.~
@459  = ~Thank you, but... I'm not sure such matchups would be something for me. I'd rather use my abilities to actually make a change, not to kill time.~
@460  = ~But... don't get me wrong, it's not that I despise such entertainment. It's still better than what they do at the Copper Coronet, from what I have heard.~
@461  = ~And you mean...~
@462  = ~Drinking until you can stand no more. Every single night.~
@463  = ~Sounds like a waste of health and resources.~
@464  = ~Arvoreen sounds like an interesting god.~
@465  = ~Gods don't exist to amuse us, Eddard, so whether we find them "interesting" is of little consequence. But... I suppose you know that. I guess you just wanted to start a conversation.~
@466  = ~Well, I just like talking to you, and you seem like a person I could learn much from. And... I think it's good when a person believes in something. Or someone. And you certainly do.~
@467  = ~Mhm, yes, I suppose I do. Not only in Arvoreen, I think.~
@468  = ~Miss Mazzy, I must say that if I ever were to suggest the next person to train the Flaming Fist in Baldur's Gate, I'd suggest you.~
@469  = ~That is very nice of you, Eddard, but I'm unsure if I could agree to such a commitment. It would depend on my work and family situation... I must admit, I worry if they are fine.~
@470  = ~Of course, I understand. Even if you'd reject the option, it would still increase your renown.~
@471  = ~Having a well-known name can be quite helpful every now and then.~
@472  = ~So, you were sent on this...~
@473  = ~Dajemma, yes! That is to make people see Minsc is strong. And so Minsc could see the world and kick evil butts in all its parts!~
@474  = ~That's an interesting custom, but I have a question.~
@475  = ~When do you send someone on such an adventure? When that person reaches a certain age? When some elders say so? When that person, I don't know, grows proper armpit hair?~
@476  = ~Egh, I'd shave it RIGHT AWAY. Seriously.~
@477  = ~I wouldn't, and I still don't, it may get itchy. But that's not the point, Skie.~
@478  = ~When you're ready, of course! And that can mean many things! When a man wants to show he truly is a man and can tell good from evil, then he may be ready! Minsc went later, with Dynaheir, when she had to go to the Sword Coast. It's been quite some time, though... Hmm.~
@479  = ~Mhm, right. I get it. I... I suppose that's all I wanted to know. Thank you, Minsc.~
@480  = ~Of course! Minsc and Boo are always happy to help! *squeak*~
@481  = ~I am strong too, but your arm, Minsc... it looks damn big! It can be quite intimidating.~
@482  = ~Minsc needs strong arms and strong legs! And a sharp blade, and skilled friends like you and Boo! All that to stop evil. That is what heroes do. Right, Boo? *squeak*~
@483  = ~Yes, I understand it and I know HOW you are using those muscles. I'm just saying they are intimidating and... it's good to have someone THAT big on our side.~
@484  = ~Our side is the side of good! So yes. That is what Minsc and this group fight for!~
@485  = ~Using muscles for evil would be wrong. So Minsc and Boo are never going that way.~
@486  = ~Of course, Minsc. I'm glad to hear that.~
@487  = ~Time may pass, but sometimes it seems like we got stuck in a warp. On one hand, I feel as if we, how you say it, kicked hundreds of evil butts, but on the other hand... you don't look much older. I'm not sure how I look, though.~
@488  = ~The more evil butts you kick, Eddard, the younger you feel! That's the old rule Minsc and Boo follow. And just looks at us! We DO look young!~
@489  = ~Heh, just as I said, you indeed do.~
@490  = ~Perhaps, if we kick enough butts, we will be able to fight evil for the next hundred years! Wouldn't that be something? *squeak*~
@491  = ~I'm not sure if that'd be something I'd like to do.~
@492  = ~I'll be really old, wrinkled, all my hair would be probably gray, and I might have problems with my bladder. I think I'd rather have some proper rest when I'm one hundred and twenty.~
@493  = ~Nalia, you seem... tired.~
@494  = ~I haven't been sleeping very well lately, but you do not need to worry, Eddard. I'll be fine... I just need some time. The last weeks weren't the easiest, so you may need to excuse my state.~
@495  = ~There's nothing to excuse, I'm just a bit worried about you and how you may be feeling.~
@496  = ~Your body shows when you are tired. Your face, your skin. And I can tell you may feel... overwhelmed.~
@497  = ~Perhaps a bit, but I know I... I'm not the only one suffering. So I find it hard to ask for a break when I know many people can't even think about it.~
@498  = ~Fine, then... just at least let me take that backpack. I could use a good workout, break a sweat, as I had a solid portion of... dried meat and... Some exercise would be nice.~
@499  = ~I suppose that would be fine... Thank you.~
@500  = ~Have you been sleeping better lately? I thought I could give you a tonic my cousin taught me to make. It can help your muscles relax.~
@501  = ~I suppose won't hurt to try, but let me take a little sip first, so—~
@502  = ~It's... mostly alcohol. Potent alcohol. Ah...~
@503  = ~I... probably should have warned you. But it was only a small sip. I hope you're okay?~
@504  = ~It's fine. I'm just a bit... surprised.~
@505  = ~Sorry. I can be a bit... reckless, sometimes.~
@506  = ~No, no, it's very... good. I like it, Eddard. I just will take a little sip, as... I wouldn't want to be woozy, we're on a mission.~
@507  = ~Of course, Nalia.~
@508  = ~Nalia, perhaps one day, if you happen to be in Baldur's Gate, I could show you my family estate. It's not a keep, but I think you may like it. We could open a bottle of wine and talk.~
@509  = ~Maybe, but... why are you offering this to me?~
@510  = ~Because friendship between noble families feels so... fickle, and sometimes it's not even real. But I like you, and it would be a nice idea to have a friend at home. Someone with whom I won't need to follow some script. It's just that. Nothing else.~
@511  = ~Oh, you thought that I... I... no. Hah. Well, I just realized how it could have sounded.~
@512  = ~Well, I'd be happy to come then. A friendly visit. Perhaps you could show me the city.~
@513  = ~Sure. And if my beloved <CHARNAME> is with us, then we could all go to a pub later.~
@514  = ~I'd love that.~
@515  = ~Then we have a deal!~
@516  = ~...excuse me? I'm not sure if I understand, Valygar.~
@517  = ~I said it saddens me to look at you.~
@518  = ~Okay... Why?~
@519  = ~Because you are a young man from a good family, yet you too were lured by the promises of magic. You are a good fighter, but still, you had to give yourself to magic. That's the sad part.~
@520  = ~Well, no need to pity me. I am doing just fine, Valygar.~
@521  = ~But thank you for your misguided concern.~
@522  = ~Valygar, I think there's so much... hate in you.~
@523  = ~Sometimes I think that something must have been gone wrong in your mind. I don't know if some woman or man broke your heart, or it's just the family problems, but I wish you had a better past.~
@524  = ~Do not think I am some kind of book you can read. You are still a young boy. Even if only a few years younger than me, you still can't tell one feeling or experience from another.~
@525  = ~So, even though I sadden you, as you once told me, you managed to stay in the same team with me. It seems you can sometimes look the other way after all.~
@526  = ~Well, I told you what I think, Eddard. I also told you that you are a good fighter, but somehow you forgot that part already.~
@527  = ~I... did not. But it pains me that you are so eager to judge others.~
@528  = ~I wish it wasn't so.~
@529  = ~It's unusual for someone like you to have a... fruitful experience with someone like <CHARNAME>. I am sorry to say that, Lady DeVir, but encounters with the drow tend to result in death for my kind. Unless it's with this Drizzt many speak of with strange admiration.~
@530  = ~Hah! Well, it's true, most surfacers do not live long enough to talk about their meeting with regular Ilythiiri, waelin. And by regular, I mean the servants of Lolth, those who raid this world and then descend into darkness again.~
@531  = ~But you stayed here.~
@532  = ~Because I do not serve Lolth, no. I serve Shar. And... I could no longer remain in the Underdark. That is why I stayed under this accursed burning globe, if you really need to know, waelin.~
@533  = ~My kind's reputation, the one you mentioned, has made my stay... difficult. But I'm not afraid to defend myself if needed.~
@534  = ~So, does that satiate your curiosity? I've shown you enough patience, so be careful how much more you ask for.~
@535  = ~Partially. However, I'm wondering if you like our food.~
@536  = ~Excuse me? You now ask me about... food? Dos ph'b'vecko, waelin! Why would it matter?~
@537  = ~I'm sure most people ask you about survival or how hard it is. You're probably sick of questions like that. So I thought about something familiar to everyone, but also something that speaks to each individual: food.~
@538  = ~This is... ridiculous. Begone! I wasted too much time on you, waelin...~
@539  = ~The last time we ate, I noticed you were chewing more carefully. Was that because you were thinking about my question?~
@540  = ~I must admit I was rarely asked about food by anyone, waelin. Back home, I would enjoy fire lichen paste spread on sporebread, with a soup... if you really must know. I'd sometimes eat it with Pyrimo caviar or the fish itself. I heard they use rothé blood to catch it.~
@541  = ~Hmm, it does sound interesting. And here? I believe we can grow more things here than where you come from. One of the benefits of living under the sun instead of a rocky ceiling.~
@542  = ~Do these... questions of yours ever end, waelin? Fine! I shall tell you. I once stole this... stew. I tasted some intense... bulb, fried tomato paste, and... seafood.~
@543  = ~Ah, the Baldurian seafood stew! And that bulb you are referring to must have been garlic, an important ingredient. I heard that stew is growing in popularity.~
@544  = ~I do not know and... this seems so trivial, waelin! Is that really how your conversations go? Your... strange customs never cease to amaze me. I... believe we should do something useful rather than talk about... nutrition. We should move on. Now.~
@545  = ~I still remember how you asked me about food, waelin. I presume you were trying to make me feel comfortable. How odd.~
@546  = ~But I must admit it was a... surprisingly interesting experience. To speak about simple things, waste time like that! Shar, evagna uns'aa, but... I... did not entirely despise it.~
@547  = ~Hah, it must have been hard to admit it. You are quite proud, Viconia, for someone who ran away from her home and had to hide under a hood to survive.~
@548  = ~Watch your mouth, waelin, because that one gesture will not help you if you keep that... impudent tone. Usstan tlun naut zaale!~
@549  = ~Fine, fine, I'm... just happy that we've been working together and that we're both alive. People may fear you, some will never get used to it, but you are an interesting being.~
@550  = ~You are walking a thin line, waelin, speaking of me as if I were some... specimen. But fine. Keep your tongue, since that's the only way you know how to... communicate. Perhaps I'll find a way to tolerate it.~
@551  = ~Thank you. Believe me or not, but think it's more than that. Are you trying to make a kind gesture here, Viconia?~
@552  = ~I think we've had enough of this discussion on pointless customs, waelin, so waste no more breath on announcing your wild fantasies and... let us move on. Now.~
@553  = ~Heh, of course, Viconia. That's what I shall do.~
@554  = ~I think my mother used to drink this... special tea she had imported from Kara-Tur. Perhaps even from Kozakura. It had a green tint and intense taste.~
@555  = ~Ah, it might have been sencha. A special tea, my friend, and by special I mean so admired that drinking it became a sort of... ritual itself.~
@556  = ~That might have been it! Yes. But... it had this strange taste. I tried it once.~
@557  = ~Preparing sencha, Eddard, is, let me say so, like art. It requires special treatment, knowledge and sensitivity! If you want to drink it as my people do, of course.~
@558  = ~I see. I suppose the right preparation is the kind of detail that can improve or completely destroy the experience.~
@559  = ~Haha, you may be right, curious one! You may indeed be right, but... if we ever have some time between chores, sparring, and other things, mayhap Yoshimo will tell you how to prepare it properly.~
@560  = ~I'd love that, thank you.~
@561  = ~Agh...~
@562  = ~Ah, it looks like my young friend's stamina is running low! Hah, perhaps it's because of the sparring we had. I told you, Eddard, to mind the energy you put in the way you use your blade. It's a more important detail than most could expect!~
@563  = ~Maybe. But wasn't that why we took off our armor and shirts? To protect them from sweat AND to make it less energy-consuming?~
@564  = ~Haha, yes, and believe me, Yoshimo does not throw off his leather before every man! Yet as we can see, you still lack proper energy distribution.~
@565  = ~Some of your blows can be stronger than mine, my friend, but you should remain careful AND mindful about the resources you have. And by resources, I also mean the power used by your muscles, hai.~
@566  = ~I... I'll try to remember it. And now, be so kind to share some of your water with me, Yoshimo. I'm really thirsty.~
@567  = ~Of course, Eddard. Yoshimo does not ignore a rescue plea, heh.~
@568  = ~Have we met before, cub?~
@569  = ~Yes, actually we have. I'm Entar Silvershield's son. We met at a ball organized for Duke Belt as a birthday gift.~
@570  = ~Ah, that trite meeting I attended. At least it was a chance to gather some information I could use later. And I did. And... yes, now I remember you. You were talking to Liia Jannath and Belt.~
@571  = ~That party was probably more suitable for someone like you and your rich father. To me, it was another day at work.~
@572  = ~Well, that's probably why you never even tried to smile. On the other hand, the smile of Sarevok Anchev would probably steal the entire show. It was so damn rare...~
@573  = ~...but what else should we have expected from someone who wanted to start a war...~
@574  = ~Expect nothing. Or the opposite, cub, expect everything. Then perhaps you won't be taken by surprise as your father was, for a moment, at the hands of Slythe and Krystin.~
@575  = ~I'm not sure I know what you're talking about, and... perhaps that's good.~
@576  = ~They killed Daddy for a moment, Eddard. These bad people and... Sarevok was behind it. But they managed to bring Daddy back.~
@577  = ~You are lucky they did, Anchev! Otherwise, we wouldn't be talking peacefully now.~
@578  = ~Let us move on now. I think I'm done with this conversation.~
@579  = ~It's funny what a great warrior you are, and, at the same time, what a horrible person, Dorn.~
@580  = ~Hah! The only "kind" of person I want to be is the living one. I do not care for pleasantries and what those like you, nobleman, think about my ways.~
@581  = ~Your ways? You mean murdering everything that moves to make sure you'll be the last man standing?~
@582  = ~Yes. And if you think I'd deny doing that, then you are a fool. That is why I'm still here. And why I am so good at what I do, nobleman.~
@583  = ~You had every chance to be a good man. And I can imagine you as a knight, I don't care if you're a half-orc or not, and what people would say about it, but... you decided to take the dark path.~
@584  = ~I decided to take the winner's path. The one of the survivor. Now stop wasting my time and begone, pup. I have no patience for those like you.~
@585  = ~And here we are. You wanted to be a survivor, and you survived, Dorn. But you are still rotting on the inside. A pity, because you are strong and not as bad looking as some may think. And I always wanted to see a half-orc as part of, let's say, the Flaming Fist.~
@586  = ~They could use some diversity in their midst.~
@587  = ~Your ideas are just fantasies, pup. Why would I join the Flaming Fist?~
@588  = ~I just told you. To make a point. To show them you are strong. But also to make them see you as an equal.~
@589  = ~Haha! We are not equal. And we will never be, pup.~
@590  = ~Wait, wait, wait! Are you telling me you could, let's say, summon a Sembian pudding? Just like that?~
@591  = ~Sure! And not just that! I can make a pudding out of EVERYTHING. If I stay focused, of course. It would be a pity if I summoned a Sembian BLACK pudding. I bet at least one of those creatures exists somewhere. But I could also turn a shoe into a pudding.~
@592  = ~Both these options sound risky. A chance for a Sembian black pudding... or a... shoe pudding. If I had to choose, the shoe pudding seems safer. After all, there is a chance it will be an actual Sembian pudding, even if it used to be a shoe.~
@593  = ~Sure... so... here it is! Bam!~
@594  = ~Bam? That's not very... magical. But, hey, it is a pudding. Hmm, I wonder what it tastes like. Hmm...~
@595  = ~Just as I thought. It tastes like feet. Bleh. And that was never my kind of kink, so... excuse me. I need to wash the taste out of my mouth somehow.~
@596  = ~So, have you been preparing some more shoe puddings lately? The fact I didn't like it doesn't mean you must feel the same way.~
@597  = ~Oh, no. I've been trying to turn it into a combat spell. Something called Neera's Puddingination.~
@598  = ~Wow, that name sounds really great. I'll say it again: NEERA'S PUDDINGINATION. I really like it. Hah.~
@599  = ~Well, it does sound interesting, yes. I bet people would happily cast it at parties, Neera.~
@600  = ~So, how is Neera's Puddingination spell is coming along, my friend?~
@601  = ~Oh, splendidly! I just need to add a few final touches and... check how the quality of components affects the spell. It may be REALLY hard to find a fresh squid tentacle...~
@602  = ~Unless you also come up with Neera's Squidification.~
@603  = ~Oh, THAT'S an idea! Thanks, Eddard!~
@604  = ~Wait—are we being serious now? Uhm... anyway... you're welcome? I guess.~
@605  = ~You certainly wanted to give your spirit a well-built body to live in and... I must say you succeeded. People would love to watch you perform all these gymnastics and present fighting styles. You could be the highlight of any ball.~
@606  = ~I always aimed for my practice to be much more than a presentation at balls, my friend. However, if it would inspire others to make at least one step towards balance, perhaps I could do it.~
@607  = ~I partially did it in Nashkel, I suppose, when I wanted to show the townsfolk what they may achieve by meditation and exercise.~
@608  = ~Well, I suppose it didn't go very well, though, as Nashkel didn't turn into the fittest town at the Sword Coast, filled with well-shaped hunks. But... maybe they just didn't get it right.~
@609  = ~If I were to decide to be a full-plate hulk or a swift monk, I suppose I would choose the monk. It's closer to who I am now.~
@610  = ~I'd approve of the choice, yes, but why are you asking yourself who you'd become? Are you planning to change your ways, my friend?~
@611  = ~Oh, no. Not really. I just like asking myself these questions: "Would I rather do blah or bleh?" Let's say it's my marching game.~
@612  = ~Heh, well, I see. Whatever works for you and lets you reach that peace of mind we all need in this manner of work.~
@613  = ~The more you wander, the more people you meet. You see new places and witness strange events. Doesn't it all... confuse you in a way, Rasaad?~
@614  = ~No. The more I see, the better I understand how people feel. How the world works. But... to succeed, you need to look deeper than the surface, observe more than somebody's actions. You need to notice what lies behind them.~
@615  = ~I suppose that's true, but seeing all the chaos and suffering... it's not easy.~
@616  = ~That part never is, my friend.~
@617  = ~You know, I've been reading stories about your kind.~
@618  = ~What stories?~
@619  = ~About vampires living in desolate places, preying on men and women, being their curse... but also about how your blood can boil. How you want to fight, feel, try to seize what was taken from you.~
@620  = ~You see, there was this novel by Hov Cindersip, in which a vampire lord kills a family, but spares one child. He feels the urge to take care of the child, but WITHOUT turning him into a vampire. The kid grows bigger, falls in love for the first time, with a neighbor named... Jinan, I think...~
@621  = ~You should not believe in everything you read. These are not vampires like me. Or those I faced.~
@622  = ~Isn't that the point? That we are all different? And that there may be different vampires?~
@623  = ~Perhaps. But now we should move on.~
@624  = ~Have you thought of writing a novel of your own? I'm sure there are many stories you could share, Hexxat. And I'd gladly read them.~
@625  = ~Many of these stories are mine alone. And they should remain that way.~
@626  = ~But why? If people could read them, perhaps they would understand your point of view better.~
@627  = ~My point of view requires my mind and... only I have that.~
@628  = ~It's funny when I think you lived through more adventures than most people ever will, Hexxat.~
@629  = ~It is those people's fault if they stay in one place.~
@630  = ~Of course, I'm not trying to blame you for anything. I just find this perspective... interesting. And perhaps it makes me wonder what life is truly about.~
@631  = ~Everyone is going to give you a different answer to that question, young one.~
@632  = ~Mmm. Right. I suppose that's true.~
@633  = ~I loved children's literature when I was younger, and I read many books about powerful animals. About a hyena vigilante becoming good and serving a trout king.~
@634  = ~Oh, and there was one about a wounded boar that also became a hero and lived a long and fruitful life. He even opened a honey shop. They called it The Boar's Honey.~
@635  = ~Rff.~
@636  = ~Ah, so... that second one actually happened? I... didn't know what, Wilson.~
@637  = ~Snuffle, snort. Roar, sniff.~
@638  = ~And his name was John. Well, good to know.~
@639  = ~From now on, I'll be sure to tell the story of John, the boar hero.~
@640  = ~Roar. Snuffle... grrr?~
@641  = ~Grr...~
@642  = ~Ah, right. I am sorry, but I'm still learning. But I'm doing good, aren't I?~
@643  = ~Roar.~
@644  = ~Good! I'm happy you think so!~
@645  = ~I doubt that my father will believe me that I fought arm in arm with such a great hero as you, Wilson.~
@646  = ~Roar, rff.~
@647  = ~You wouldn't mind telling him what a good warrior he sired? Well... Uhm... I suppose that would convince him. And I'll happily welcome you at the Silvershield estate.~
@648  = ~Roar, snuffle. Sniff.~
@649  = ~Hah! Good! And yes, of course, I'll buy some nice honey for a treat. Perhaps even John's famous honey, if I manage to get a jar.~
@650  = ~It looks like you're making yourself feel at home in this group, Eddard. That's good. And I see how you look at <CHARNAME>. Well, <PRO_HESHE> saved many of us. But others had to fall nonetheless.~
@651  = ~I understand that, Jaheira, and I don't expect <CHARNAME> to save me every time we are in combat. I can take care of myself, but thank you for your concern. Even if unsolicited. This time, at least.~
@652  = ~I am simply making an observation. You seem to be getting to know <PRO_HIMHER> better, and I wanted to make sure you are aware of the risk that is associated with that.~
@653  = ~Jaheira, stop acting as if there was something criminal about someone wanting to know more about me! Gods, sometimes I wish you'd choke on those comments of yours...~
@654  = ~Eddard, she's just trying to warn you. She's suffered greatly since she agreed to help me. Working with me is... dangerous. To say the least. You should remember that.~
@655  = ~Choke on them? Well, what an interesting way for a leader to speak to <PRO_HISHER> friend. I tried to warn Eddard because I didn't want any of you to get hurt.~
@656  = ~But perhaps I should indeed keep these comments to myself.~
@657  = ~I understand. And... I feel as if I was getting into the middle of something, and perhaps I... shouldn't influence the dynamics of this group so much. Excuse me.~
@658  = ~I'm puzzled. You just regained your freedom and instead of savoring it, you rush headlong into new battles by <CHARNAME>'s side. And mine. Your life choices aside, doesn't the last part trouble you?~
@659  = ~No. Why? You're not going to try to scare me away from this group, right? I'm a horror novel enthusiast, so... it may be a hard task, Hexxat.~
@660  = ~Why should I even try to scare you? If you're not a good fit for this group, you will die sooner than later.~
@661  = ~Are you hoping for me to die? Because I'm here and... what? I wouldn't mind knowing <CHARNAME> a bit better? For some reason, you started behaving like that when <PRO_HESHE> shared <PRO_HISHER> water with me.~
@662  = ~Accusing a vampire of jealousy? You are a strange man.~
@663  = ~Hexxat, stop teasing Eddard. I like him. He's fine.~
@664  = ~Eddard, it looks like Hexxat doesn't like you, so it would be best if you made your presence in this group a bit less... intense. I like Hexxat, so make it easier for all of us.~
@665  = ~See? Problem solved. I'm fine. It looks like I'm not going anywhere, so let's try to get along.~
@666  = ~I cannot promise anything like that. But indeed, some things became more clear anyway.~
@667  = ~I'll take a step back and let you, living, play while you still can.~
@668  = ~So you'd rather make sure she's more comfortable than...~
@669  = ~Than?~
@670  = ~Never mind.~
@671  = ~My friend, I was wondering if you are strong enough to help and protect <CHARNAME>. I must say, I realized that <PRO_HESHE>'s living under a lot of stress. It would be best if <PRO_HERHIS> companions could take some of the burden on their shoulders.~
@672  = ~Firstly, I can help with whatever <CHARNAME> would want my help. Secondly, I... think it should be for <CHARNAME> to decide if such help is required. You're not <PRO_HISHER> ambassador. I'm open to any suggestions <PRO_HESHE> may have... when they come out of <PRO_HISHER> own lips.~
@673  = ~Rasaad, Eddard is right and... I'd rather you listen to him. Eddard is smart, and I think his presence is growing on me.~
@674  = ~Eddard, Rasaad is right. I could really use some support. Please, don't add even more problems but rather help with what we already have on our plates. Rasaad can instruct you if you need guidance.~
@675  = ~Of course... I am sorry if I offended you in any way, <CHARNAME>. And I apologize to you as well, Eddard.~
@676  = ~Well... I think I'll handle it on my own.~
@677  = ~Have you noticed <PRO_HISHER> collarbone, Eddard? It's rather... attractive! (she looks at you)~
@678  = ~Hmm, I guess it is. But... I don't know what you see in collarbones. It's just... uhm... a bone. There are other things about <PRO_HIMHER> that can draw attention.~
@679  = ~Oh, really? Well, it's good to know you look at <PRO_HIMHER> that way. But shush. I think <PRO_HESHE>'s listening to us! Agh, I wish I could just make us quieter. I'll stand over there and... you go there. Let's pretend nothing happened. Now.~
@680  = ~(Smile at Eddard)~
@681  = ~(Smile at Neera)~
@682  = ~(He smiles back at you, and you can tell it's an honest smile)~
@683  = ~Hah! It looks <PRO_HESHE> likes you. Or... something.~
@684  = ~I've been spotted, Eddard...!~
@685  = ~It's not a bad thing. I think you wanted to be noticed, Neera. Anyway, it seems that <PRO_HESHE> likes you. Maybe you'll get to see that collarbone from a closer distance.~
@686  = ~Hmm. When I see how you act, I have a feeling that all you want is attention, pup. You're almost begging for it.~
@687  = ~You're only embarrassing yourself, that's how I see it.~
@688  = ~I don't think I am. Perhaps it's you who's embarrassing himself with that neverending grimace of disdain.~
@689  = ~Hmm? Is that all you've got?~
@690  = ~Stow it, Dorn. I won't have you insulting someone I like.~
@691  = ~Eddard, please. Give me a break. You could be more serious about all of this. That's actually something you could learn from Dorn.~
@692  = ~See? I was right.~
@693  = ~If you truly like him, then perhaps the two of you are worth each other. Weak things.~
@694  = ~Is that really what you think?~
@695  = ~You heard <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@696  = ~When I look at you, I think you're an interesting choice for a pet. Because that's what you're aspiring to be with that... sweet attitude of yours, hmm? <CHARNAME>'s pet?~
@697  = ~I don't think I'm anyone's pet, Viconia. I'm my own man.~
@698  = ~Viconia, you're crossing a line here. Stop insulting Eddard.~
@699  = ~Eddard, please, you should know your place in this party. I need you to obey those that are doing this longer than you.~
@700  = ~Ah, of course. Your <PRO_MASTERMISTRESS> has spoken, Eddard.~
@701  = ~And now you're treating me like a dog? Perhaps the two of you are worth each other after all.~
@702  = ~...I'm not sure I understand, Eddard. Are you saying that you... think <CHARNAME> is attractive? I mean... I don't know if that's how we should be looking at <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@703  = ~It's not like that! I said... Eh, never mind. And... just never mind.~
@704  = ~I'm sorry, perhaps I just misunderstood something.~
@705  = ~Yes. Perhaps you did. (Eddard looks at you troubled)~
@706  = ~(Ignore him and smile at Aerie instead)~
@707  = ~(Smile at Eddard to show him everything is fine, and he doesn't need to be embarrassed, no matter what he meant)~
@708  = ~Oh... Well, I think <CHARNAME> may need us. I'll get back to the rest of the party in a second.~
@709  = ~Right... we will both be back... in a moment.~
@710  = ~Heh... Erm... I'll get back to work in a second, <CHARNAME>. No worries. I may just need to take... a sip of water.~
@711  = ~Now, I suppose there are a couple of things I could teach you about tactics and leadership, Eddard. I believe you should at all times watch out for <CHARNAME>'s needs.~
@712  = ~And remember <PRO_HESHE> is the most important part of this group. Probably irreplaceable.~
@713  = ~I know that, and you do not need to teach me, Anomen. I, too, know the basics of leadership. And I'd rather hear what <CHARNAME> needs from <PRO_HIMHER>, not from you.~
@714  = ~Hmm, I'm sure if you'd truly prefer that.~
@715  = ~Anomen, stop it.~
@716  = ~Eddard, Anomen is just trying to help. Respect him, I value his opinion.~
@717  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, I... I don't know what this was all about.~
@718  = ~Mhm. Of course. I suppose that's an order.~
@719  = ~You... let my sister die? And then you disposed of her? I cannot ignore this <CHARNAME>. People die, sometimes we can do nothing about it, but... I... just can't let it slide.~
@720  = ~Your mission is important, so I won't leave you, but this letdown has left a bad taste in my mouth I won't be able to wash off.~
@721  = ~I must admit, it's good to be free and have the chance to enjoy little things! Mrs. Bridehoove, our pastry chef at the Silvershield estate, used to make these mincemeat pies—give me one, and I'm done for today. Joking, of course, they would be stale halfway from the Gate, but anyway—it feels damn good to be free.~
@722  = ~Oh, I DO remember those pies!~
@723  = ~Haha! I bet you do! I once saw you eat FIVE of them. AT ONCE.~
@724  = ~Shush! You weren't supposed to tell anyone, Eddard!~
@725  = ~I wonder if Mrs. Bridehoove is still there, working for my family. It's been so long, since—you know.~
@726  = ~Right... The attack on the caravan and your... abduction.~
@727  = ~We don't have time to discuss this. To be honest, I'd rather move on than waste my time on idle chatters.~
@728  = ~Yes. It feels like it happened ages ago. But I was quite lucky to have survived at all. It was quite unlikely. Skie thought I was gone, and so did everyone else.~
@729  = ~I must admit, though, that there is this grain of bitter disappointment and embarrassment in me. I was supposed to help those people, make sure the caravan reaches its destination. It was an important task, time was of the essence in those circumstances, the crisis. Not only did I fail, but also ended up one of the only two people who survived the ambush.~
@730  = ~But... it's not like it was up to you who would make it and who... you know.~
@731  = ~No, but it's worse than scars. That... experience of failure. So when I mentioned disappointment, I meant with myself. Perhaps it will subside at some point, but now it feels quite bitter.~
@732  = ~Disappointment is always bitter. But guilt can be even worse.~
@733  = ~Well, they were just... unlucky. All of you were. What happened is not that uncommon, though. Especially for those poorer than you.~
@734  = ~We don't have time for this. We should move on, Eddard, before we waste the entire <DAYNIGHT>...~
@735  = ~True. So very true.~
@736  = ~Ah, I see you certainly know how to needle someone like me. But I suppose what you're saying is... not untrue.~
@737  = ~Father would often say that "responsibility can be like shooting arrows at a mirror: once you hit, look at all these cracks and remember how it was to see the image whole."~
@738  = ~Ugh, I heard that at least once a month.~
@739  = ~I suppose I know what he meant. I did my best, I was responsible, but being in that position inevitably makes you face difficulties. And once you see all these "cracks", you may need to remind yourself what it was all for. And that you were not the only one there. A pity, though, that the other person was Vully. Perhaps if it was someone else, the burden of failure could be divided and carried on more than just one set of shoulders.~
@740  = ~Anyway, I'm not here to complain. Sorry. I didn't mean to get you down, discourage you, or anything like that. I... probably should have talked about the mincemeat pies rather than how it feels to fail.~
@741  = ~But I heard you prevented a war up north. The one the Iron Throne and Sarevok tried to incite!~
@742  = ~Yes. Luckily, this job doesn't only bring failures, but also some victories.~
@743  = ~Yes, I suppose. But—look, if you want to talk about how you felt, it's fine. You don't need to change the subject.~
@744  = ~It was a long time ago, and I can barely remember how everything happened. I just... fought some battles, faced a few people...~
@745  = ~Perhaps even more than one!~
@746  = ~Look... we should move on.~
@747  = ~Well said, <CHARNAME>, well said.~
@748  = ~No. It's okay. I know what happened, and sprinkling that wound with salt isn't going to help. I just need some time.~
@749  = ~Hah! Well, I didn't realize you were that humble! Averting so many tragedies is a huge achievement, so you shouldn't be hesitant to talk about it. It's a big deal, and you deserve some praise for a job well done.~
@750  = ~Ah, right. Caelar and the crusade. I heard about that while I was in captivity. People talked about her and that army she led. It caused quite some chaos.~
@751  = ~Anyway, I must say it may be quite interesting to work with the Hero of Baldur's Gate. That city is my little homeland, and I'm glad it wasn't turned into ash and rubble.~
@752  = ~Bad moment, huh? Well, maybe we'll talk some other time.~
@753  = ~I should tell you that I sent a note to the Silvershield estate, <CHARNAME>. It would be cruel to keep them thinking that I'm dead. Well, maybe I could keep it up with Aunt Olha to avoid her parties... and to take her down a peg or two! A spiteful one she is. You wouldn't like her. Well, SHE wouldn't like YOU.~
@754  = ~Wait, why?! I'm beyond likable!~
@755  = ~It's good that you let your family know.~
@756  = ~I suppose you know best who and how to inform.~
@757  = ~I don't care if you informed your family that you're back from the dead. Let us move on.~
@758  = ~I bet you are! Just look at that face of yours. But to make her like you, you'd need to be a Sembian artist, eager to give her a discount on weirdly eccentric and slightly off-putting sculptures.~
@759  = ~She's the worst!~
@760  = ~Yes, she's that kind of person.~
@761  = ~I see. Well, anyway, it's good that you let your family know.~
@762  = ~Right. About what you said earlier—I suppose you know best who and how to inform.~
@763  = ~Eh... I don't care who she is, what she's like, or who she would approve of. Let's move on, I don't have time for this nonsense.~
@764  = ~With the letter, I sent them this little locket I had taken with me as a token of good luck. This way, they'll know it's not some kind of trick. They'll know it's me and... perhaps it will be for the best if I avoid them for a while. Otherwise, father may start interrogating me... or even worse—put me through extra sparring classes to make sure a situation like this never happens again.~
@765  = ~Tell me, how did you like my father?~
@766  = ~He seems all right.~
@767  = ~He cares about his city.~
@768  = ~He can be a handful...~
@769  = ~He's a good man, I suppose, but may be difficult to work with.~
@770  = ~He seems impulsive while expecting everyone else to be quite the opposite.~
@771  = ~He is a hypocrite.~
@772  = ~I hate him.~
@773  = ~I don't know him that well.~
@774  = ~I don't know, and I don't care. What I know is that we should be moving.~
@775  = ~Hmm, you speak about him kindly. Hah, I'm not sure everyone would agree with you, but... he is a good man.~
@776  = ~Hmm, that's true. He's not a bad man, and he cares a lot, but it doesn't make him a saint... He has his... moods. But everyone does, I suppose.~
@777  = ~Strong words! But I didn't expect you to love him. He's not your father and... he doesn't make things easy for his kids either. But he's a good man. Just... demanding?~
@778  = ~Mhm. Right.~
@779  = ~I suppose hot temper runs in the family. From what I heard, my grandfather had it too. Maybe I have it as well...~
@780  = ~.And Skie... You know her.~
@781  = ~I suppose we are alike, it just manifests itself differently. We may dislike it, we may think it's not true, but it matters who brought us into this world. Would you agree?~
@782  = ~You know who father was, don't you?~
@783  = ~I... don't want to talk about this, Eddard. Just... let us move on. I'm done with this nonsense.~
@784  = ~Heh, I heard, yes. But I suppose that's good. It spares you another awkward coming out. I can imagine people react in all sorts of ways when they find out that the person who sired you was the infamous God of Murder. It can be a real party-killer in some circles.~
@785  = ~But you don't seem to be bothered by that.~
@786  = ~Doesn't it frighten you or something?~
@787  = ~It is! And even a Child of Bhaal deserves a party every now and then! One during which <PRO_HESHE> doesn't need to hide who <PRO_HESHE> is!~
@788  = ~I'm done talking about this. Let us move  on, Eddard.~
@789  = ~True. You too deserve some normal fun. A garden party. With refreshing drinks and tiny tartlets. ~
@790  = ~As I said, it does matter who our parents are, but it doesn't mean their blood will affect everyone the same way. Let me take a look at you... hmm. Looks good. The face, the chest... No, I don't think I can see any signs of abyssal corruption, nothing that would instantly make you a copy of Bhaal. I know, I know, some people in Baldur's Gate still expect that one day you'll just burst into hellish flames or something like that.~
@791  = ~Sorry for this long introduction. All jokes aside, this entire speech was to... let you know that who you are is fine by me. You saved me, and I know you stopped a war. That's more than many other "heroes of Baldur's Gate" have done over the last ten years.~
@792  = ~So... as long as you don't mind my own little idiosyncrasies, I think we can respect each other just as we are. And... I won't lie, I'd like that. I appreciate honesty.~
@793  = ~We're on the same page, then.~
@794  = ~Right. Anyway, I think it's time to move on.~
@795  = ~I'm happy to hear that!~
@796  = ~Of course, of course.~
@797  = ~Mmm. You're not in the mood for a conversation. Fine, then.~
@798  = ~ Forty-seven, forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty. Right. Could you pass me that cloth? I... had to gather my thoughts, and I like to exercise when doing so.~
@799  = ~Sure. Here.~
@800  = ~Would you like to tell me what you needed to think about?~
@801  = ~I'm not your servant, go and get it yourself. And leave me be, I too need to think about something.~
@802  = ~Thank you!~
@803  = ~What you do here, it's all quite serious. I hope I can help you properly, that's why I want to stay in shape. Physically, mentally and...~
@804  = ~And...?~
@805  = ~Whatever. Do it quietly, then. I want to have some sleep soon.~
@806  = ~I've been to some dark places, last year was a difficult one, and I'm glad it's over. And I am in better spirits now, but it also means I may need to act differently. Learn to deal with new kinds of challenges.~
@807  = ~Being a slave can break your soul, and while I feel better now, this is still a transition phase. I need more strength to recover fully. And by the way, your life isn't exactly a piece of cake either. Unless the cake is on fire, guarded by an undead dragon and... a death curse, perhaps? Assisting you is a chance for me to improve, but, as I've said, I haven't dealt with such challenges for a while and may need a second or two to adapt.~
@808  = ~But hey, I can already tell that this entire adventure will get me a few scares and make my chest harrier, hah.~
@809  = ~You'll need to shave it with a blade barrier!~
@810  = ~Just... don't push yourself too much. You said it yourself, your last year was different from what we're doing now. I don't want you to get hurt or something.~
@811  = ~Eh, I don't think I want to spend more time on your jumping between serious topics and jokes. We should get some sleep.~
@812  = ~Nah, I'll leave it like that, so people could get jealous.~
@813  = ~It's fine. It really is.~
@814  = ~As you may have noticed, I tend to joke when things get serious, but that's how I've learned to cope with stress. Even back home. Skie always noticed when I was under too much pressure and helped me blow off some steam. She would challenge me to an archery matchup to get my mind off other things. If not that, she presented a dreadful alternative—she would want to do my nails and... I always preferred to take care of my nails and hair on my own.~
@815  = ~And I also learned to joke to lighten the mood. Somehow it helped me deal with new tasks, challenges and our father's ways of making me better. "You need to be prepared for every scenario, boy." I rarely had any control over the scenarios I needed to test out. But I played along. Learned. How to fight. How to manage. Endure.~
@816  = ~At least I look good thanks to all that exercise. I've got strong bones and muscles. But also some unfulfilled dreams, of course.~
@817  = ~Like what?~
@818  = ~I'm done talking. I think we both need some rest, so let's stop chatting and finally go to sleep.~
@819  = ~You may laugh, but while my friends would get scolded for breaking a window or doing other stupid things adolescent boys do, I had to take diplomacy classes. So... I regret I couldn't cause normal problems, get into fights, try things for the first time. All of this came to me much later than to my friends. And some things I might have missed forever.~
@820  = ~Oh well, at least my sister was there with me, so we could regret not doing things together. Heh.~
@821  = ~Anyway, I still have the last series of sit-ups to do. Perhaps you want to hold my feet or join me? That way we can talk another moment.~
@822  = ~Hmm, why not.~
@823  = ~Sorry, but no. I have other things to do, so let's end this conversation. There are matters I need to attend to before I go to sleep.~
@824  = ~Great! Perhaps I should tell you a story about the time Skie wanted to practice her make-up skills and painted our father's bust! Hah, that was a good one! You should have seen his face when he found this masterpiece!~
@825  = ~Mhm. Fine. I won't take any more of your time, then.~
@826  = ~Well, this should become our routine, <CHARNAME>. And... it's true... Eddard, you're really here! Your father asked me to confirm the revelation brought by that note! Your parents couldn't believe it, even though you also sent them your father's locket.~
@827  = ~Missini, my old friend! Who would have guessed you'd still be working for the Silvershields. I hope they gave you a pay rise.~
@828  = ~You haven't changed a bit, young lord.~
@829  = ~Well, he only got some bruises, lost a year of his life, and...~
@830  = ~It's fine, Skie. Let's not drag it up right now. Please.~
@831  = ~Believe me or not, I am glad you stayed with my parents. They've always trusted you.~
@832  = ~I wouldn't leave them. Especially after the news about your death. False news, as we can see.~
@833  = ~I would call it a... temporary death. That's how it felt. I was turned into a slave and... I wouldn't call that a life.~
@834  = ~Is it true what you wrote in your letter? That Vully Grip was involved? He joined the bandits who treated you that way?~
@835  = ~Yes. Sadly. But he's gone now. It looks like <CHARNAME> and Skie dealt with him.~
@836  = ~Humph! Good riddance! That monster knew how important that mission was and how your father and mother would feel about losing their child...~
@837  = ~Perhaps it would be better to focus on the fact that I'm back.~
@838  = ~Let me tell you this, then—you should be back home now.~
@839  = ~Maybe, but... look, I went through a lot, Missini, everyone knows it. This... was hard. I have to process it all, and I'd rather do it while helping those who need me, instead of staring at the walls in my room and thinking how things could have gone differently. So... I'm staying put.~
@840  = ~It looks like <CHARNAME> has this... special power that draws the Silvershields like moths to a flame. Forgive me this comparison, young lord.~
@841  = ~There are some moths that look nice. Most are nasty, though. But... let's not make a big deal out of it.~
@842  = ~Missini...~
@843  = ~I know, my lord, I just... I'm glad to see you. Even if it's here and not where you belong, among people who miss you the most.~
@844  = ~Missini, don't make it harder than it already is. I told you. I need some... space right now!~
@845  = ~I'm sorry. My comments might have been a bit... unfortunate.~
@846  = ~As for you, <CHARNAME>...~
@847  = ~Yes, yes. I should remember who I am working with and keep him safe.~
@848  = ~Just spare me the talk, Missini. It's getting old.~
@849  = ~... right. I suppose you know what to do, and... Perhaps I too should trust you.~
@850  = ~I know I may sound ungrateful, <CHARNAME>, and... perhaps I owe you an apology. But both Eddard and Skie were always important to me. Not just because I work for the Silvershields, but also because I watched them grow up and learn their first lessons.~
@851  = ~I saw that young man shave for the first time. And then, I had to help him with his cuts.~
@852  = ~Yes, yes... let's embarrass me a bit more. Slavery clearly wasn't enough.~
@853  = ~What I mean is... I care. But I suppose I should just accept that things change. I'll tell your parents that you're truly alive. And that you'll be back when you're done with other things. When you're ready.~
@854  = ~Thank you, Missini.~
@855  = ~And Miss Skie... thank you for investigating the case. For uncovering the truth about your brother's fate. It's good to see how a heroine is born...~
@856  = ~Wait... what? That was actually... nice. Thank you, Missini.~
@857  = ~Now, it's time for me to leave.~
@858  = ~Good luck... to all of you.~
@859  = ~That was... a somewhat... intense series of events just before bedtime. A workout, our talk, and now this. But... I suppose we can finally rest now. We'll talk again when everyone has taken a deep breath. I certainly need it.~
@860  = ~I'm wondering how Jackly's doing... I hope he's fine.~
@861  = ~Who's Jackly?~
@862  = ~I don't give a damn about whoever that is. Let's just move on. And please, stop slowing us down.~
@863  = ~Jackly was my friend. A fellow slave. He was a half-elf, more or less my age, kind. We always had each other's back. When you're treated like an item that can be thrown away the very second it breaks, your survival may depend on such support.~
@864  = ~He was the first person I met. When they locked me in a cell with no clothing, no blanket, he started talking to me. I cried at first. A grown man and I wept like a little kid. Jackly told me his story and how to survive in this new world I was stuck in. He gave me water. There's a chance I'd be dead by now if it wasn't for him.~
@865  = ~He was bought like... four months before you freed me. This lady saw him and said he looked too fair to be caged like an animal.~
@866  = ~I've seen worse buyers and the moment they opened the cage, she came up to him and gave him her cloak, so... there is a huge chance he's alive. I really hope he's alive. But all of that also made me think about noble families...~
@867  = ~I realized that I'm glad people who worked for my family got their workers the... right way. Hired them. But... I'm afraid some families don't handle things that way. That lady who... bought Jackly... I hope she did it to change his fate. But that wasn't the case for other buyers. They just wanted to own people like property.~
@868  = ~This is really, really, really creepy. Everything you're saying, Eddard.~
@869  = ~It is, Skie.~
@870  = ~Gods... people can be so... cruel. I'm happy we can be better than this...~
@871  = ~That's also why I told Missini that I can do more good by staying with you. I can help people who are suffering or those in a similar situation.~
@872  = ~It's understandable that you want to help people. Make a change.~
@873  = ~Do you really think you'll see Jackly again? He can be anywhere.~
@874  = ~I don't want to listen to this. I'd rather pretend things like that don't happen.~
@875  = ~Whatever. I think we should move on, Eddard. Please, stop slowing us down.~
@876  = ~I know it sounds trivial, but... yes. Perhaps I'd also like to build a reputation of my own. So people know one person can be many things. A nobleman. A slave. Or... a former slave. And, if I succeed, a decent guy who gives a damn?~
@877  = ~I don't know. Perhaps we'll never meet again, but... I don't know. I kinda hope we will. Even if only so I could tell him that I'm grateful for his help.~
@878  = ~Anyway, I'm telling you all these sad things again! Agh! Sorry. I PROMISE, next time we're going to do something nicer. I mean, talk about something nicer. I suppose anything would be better, so... that's not a difficult promise to keep.~
@879  = ~Heh, indeed, it's not!~
@880  = ~It's not a sad story, actually. It shows that even in a grave hour, you may find people you can count on. Trust.~
@881  = ~Do me a favor and simply don't slow me down anymore. Enough of these idle chatters.~
@882  = ~Good! And... thanks for listening.~
@883  = ~I guess you're right. But there are some bitter parts here, too. So... sorry for that. But still, thanks for listening. I probably needed that.~
@884  = ~Yet they do, regardless of your wishes.~
@885  = ~Mhm. Fine. If that's how you want it to be.~
@886  = ~Hey, I have a riddle for you! Listen carefully: How often does Entar Silvershield take a bath?~
@887  = ~Oh, oh! I know this one!~
@888  = ~Shush! Let <PRO_HIMHER> think!~
@889  = ~Go on! Take a guess!~
@890  = ~Every day, I hope.~
@891  = ~Every week?~
@892  = ~Once a month?~
@893  = ~Once a year?~
@894  = ~Never?~
@895  = ~He never leaves the bathtub?~
@896  = ~I don't have time for jokes... Let us move on.~
@897  = ~Once in a SILVERYMOON. Hah!~
@898  = ~Excuse me?~
@899  = ~Huh. Good one!~
@900  = ~Gods... kill me already.~
@901  = ~I don't have time for this. Let's move on! Now!~
@902  = ~Silverymoon. It's a city up north. And the idiom is "once in a blue moon". It means "rarely". Get it? Hah!~
@903  = ~Haha! Oh, Eddard.~
@904  = ~Well, that's one of my favorites.~
@905  = ~But you get it, right? Silverymoon. It's a city up north. And the idiom is "once in a blue moon". It means "rarely". Get it?~
@906  = ~Haha! Oh, Eddard...~
@907  = ~That's one of my favorites.~
@908  = ~Maybe you'll like this one: Why are there no werewolves in Baldur's Gate?~
@909  = ~I give up.~
@910  = ~Please... no...~
@911  = ~NO... Don't do this!~
@912  = ~Don't—~
@913  = ~I think I know, but go on. I know you want to say it.~
@914  = ~Eddard! We don't have time for this. Let us move on...~
@915  = ~Because Baldur's Gate has SILVERSHIELDS!~
@916  = ~I had no idea you were such a punster.~
@917  = ~All right, you've passed the test. You're ready to become a dad. You have all the puns you need to embarrass your kids.~
@918  = ~Eddard... We don't have time for this. Let us move on. NOW!~
@919  = ~Heh. You see, I used to joke like that all the time. Our parents are so serious about being a noble or the role of a Duke. But we are still people. So I kept telling these... not poor jokes to remind them about it. I know that with power comes responsibility. But it doesn't mean we can't laugh.~
@920  = ~A title can be a burden sometimes, and there were days when everyone at the estate was just quiet. I found it hard to bear when I was a kid. Eventually, I stopped joking so much when father started giving me more important tasks. Still, I never forgot that life can't be only about titles and being serious and humble. You need to learn to laugh at yourself. Otherwise, you can get really bitter.~
@921  = ~I hope father remembers those jokes. Even if I'm not around. But I suppose it may be hard to remember them when people get scared. And the vision of a war can scare most men and women.~
@922  = ~So you think your father has a tendency to be bitter, yes?~
@923  = ~I suppose it could be difficult, yes. The war, the bandit attacks...~
@924  = ~You realize you were being childish, while your father was probably afraid.~
@925  = ~We don't have time to discuss it. We should get going.~
@926  = ~YES.~
@927  = ~Well... he can be that way. Sometimes.~
@928  = ~True... Eh...~
@929  = ~I... I know...~
@930  = ~Father is serious because that's who he is. But I'd like to know we could also talk about things other than changes in the city infrastructure or investigating cases of forgery. I wanted to know that sometimes we can just be father and son.~
@931  = ~So I hope he remembers those jokes, but also that he realized why I was telling them. That he actually listened. Maybe we'll have a pint when I'm back. Or when he retires...~
@932  = ~Anyway, I suppose that's enough jokes for today. Let's move on. We can talk again soon.~
@933  = ~Mhm. It looks like you're not in the mood right now.~
@934  = ~Our last talk made me wonder if I'd like to take the Duke's position after my father retires.~
@935  = ~Would you?~
@936  = ~Look, I don't have time for this. We should move on. The sooner, the better.~
@937  = ~I can joke around, but... I think I would. If it helped to achieve some stabilization in the city and if I knew I could actually offer some aid, then I would accept it. But I wouldn't want that to happen just yet. I feel I still have much to learn.~
@938  = ~And perhaps I could use Skie's help. She's smarter than some may think. And she's creative once you make her focus on something, and once she sees her input matters.~
@939  = ~I know I've been joking around a lot, and I'm not very seasoned yet, but I think I'm also capable of inducing a change. I sometimes struggle when it comes to taking the best approach, but... I suppose that will come with experience. It... does come with experience... right?~
@940  = ~I think so. I too had to learn how to be a leader and... oh boy, I made so many mistakes right after I had to run away from Candlekeep.~
@941  = ~Of course it comes with experience. And with time. And you can also get counselors who will discuss various scenarios with you. I think that's how it works.~
@942  = ~I don't know. And I don't care. I think it would be best if we moved on.~
@943  = ~Hmm, it does make sense. I may need to give it some more thought.~
@944  = ~Thank you for lending me your ear.~
@945  = ~Eh... right...~
@946  = ~It looks like I'll learn a lot from working with you. And maybe, just maybe, though, I'll be a better candidate to help my family when they need it. I think I made the right choice staying with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@947  = ~Ahem!~
@948  = ~Of course, Skie, none of this would be possible if it wasn't for you.~
@949  = ~Oh, I do have good ideas. Sometimes. Well, most of the time.~
@950  = ~So... thanks for taking me in.~
@951  = ~No problem. You're a fine companion, and you make some things easier.~
@952  = ~You looked like someone who can handle a fight, and that's the sort of companion I need right now. Upcoming battles will be hard. I don't want them to be fatal for us. Only for our enemies.~
@953  = ~Yes, yes, yes, but let us move on now. Seriously. We're not here to chat.~
@954  = ~I know what you mean.~
@955  = ~A pity you weren't there instead of Vully. Things might have gone better then. Perhaps we would have saved the caravan and its people.~
@956  = ~I was still a beginner back then. I'm not sure if I would be of much use.~
@957  = ~We can't change the past, just like we can't turn a river's tide, Eddard.~
@958  = ~We don't have time for such talks. We should move on. Please.~
@959  = ~Mmm. I'm just playing the "what if" game, it's one of my things. To be honest, you remind me a lot of Jackly. He saved me, and so did you. And he cared. I suppose do you too. About many things.~
@960  = ~I do. That's why I'm doing all of this.~
@961  = ~I don't. Not as much as you think. It would be best if you finally realized that and made it less... awkward.~
@962  = ~Eddard, please. You are slowing us down. Over and over and over again. I need you to stop this. Please!~
@963  = ~Heh. Well... thanks. For being like that. It makes my life a bit easier. So, if you were ever afraid you may turn into something like Bhaal... I must say I don't see much of him in you. Not that I've met him personally, but... you don't seem that... dark. Evil? Grim? Or vicious.~
@964  = ~Thanks. It's good to know some people see someone else in me, not just a... Bhaalspawn.~
@965  = ~Believe me, there's much of him in me. I just know how to manage this... potential and power. That's what I do.~
@966  = ~You're wrong. I can feel Bhaal inside me and I know I'm his child. What makes us different, though, is the fact I KNOW how to see my plans through…~
@967  = ~We don't have time for this. We need to move on. Now.~
@968  = ~Always at your service.~
@969  = ~You do it very well, then.~
@970  = ~If that's how it is... I won't trouble you any longer. Excuse me.~
@971  = ~Let's say you can have one moment of luxury. Anything you want. What would you pick?~
@972  = ~A nice afternoon at a bathhouse, getting all that dirt off me. Perhaps I'd have some nice drink with my bath...~
@973  = ~One day at a library, alone, with access to all archives and perhaps some nice brew to drink.~
@974  = ~A feast with all kinds of food. Savory, sweet, sour. Perhaps with some wine or freshly squeezed juice? Or both.~
@975  = ~A moment among interesting people, perhaps at a ball, where I am the center of attention. Nice conversation, some laughs, perhaps a show of some sort?~
@976  = ~A massage by a skilled person with strong arms who would take good care of. I can imagine that could be something.~
@977  = ~It's not exactly a moment of luxury, but some quiet time at a grove, maybe near a nice, refreshing spring. Something like that, I guess.~
@978  = ~That may not be luxury, but an evening at a pub, laughing, eating some bread and cheese. It would be nice.~
@979  = ~I don't know and... never mind. Please, don't waste my time on such pointless questions.~
@980  = ~Ah, I can imagine that. Heh. It could indeed be nice and bring pleasure to a tired body and mind.~
@981  = ~Hah, I've been there. I had to attend to such meetings and balls. It could indeed be nice and refreshing.~
@982  = ~Hmm, I hadn't considered this option, but... perhaps such a moment would indeed bring some rest to a tired soul. Maybe add a walk with someone you like. Yes, that doesn't sound bad.~
@983  = ~Sounds perfect, actually.~
@984  = ~Watching how much you do every day, I'd say you deserve such a moment. You spend days or weeks dealing with someone else's problems and... I know that's a good thing, but it doesn't mean you do not deserve some pleasure and—this kind of reward that would be only for you.~
@985  = ~I hope that when the most urgent work is done, you'll get such a moment.~
@986  = ~Thank you. Maybe it's indeed going to happen. One day, that is.~
@987  = ~It's just a silly dream, and dreams don't come true. Some dreams are better when they remain fantasies and lose their magic when you try to live them.~
@988  = ~We don't have time for such talks, Eddard. We need to go. Now.~
@989  = ~Perhaps I'll help you make it happen. If I'll be in the position to help, of course. (smiles)~
@990  = ~Yes, there are dreams that better remain exactly what they are, dreams, but it doesn't mean you have to resign from all of them. And... let's be honest, a dream of one luxurious day isn't the same as a dream of creating a new interdimensional... race, or something. One day of luxury is way easier, you know.~
@991  = ~If I were to decide on such a day, it would be going to my favorite alehouse. Having some ale with my comrades—you included, of course. Playing cards, perhaps eating some roasted pork, so we could continue the evening without passing out. I don't like that. And I'm not a heavy drinker. But... in the past, I couldn't do any of that without sneaking out. My family frowned upon such activities.~
@992  = ~Then, maybe we could just talk. Throw stones into the sea or whatever. Talking with someone I like is the best part. Without worrying that I'll make some "undiplomatic mistake" or offend someone because I didn't use the proper title.~
@993  = ~Hah! By the way: do you have any titles I should know about? Anything else than the Hero of Baldur's Gate, of course!~
@994  = ~Nah, it's just <CHARNAME>. I like to keep it simple.~
@995  = ~Oh! You can call me "Lord"!~
@996  = ~Mm, I wouldn't mind being called "Lady"!~
@997  = ~I suppose "Sir" is the most appropriate!~
@998  = ~I suppose "Ma'am" would be quite correct.~
@999  = ~Call me "Your Highest Emanation of Sexiness"!~
@1000 = ~Please, give me a break. Let's just move on. I don't want to waste time on talks like this one.~
@1001 = ~Just <CHARNAME> it is! By the way, I like your name. It suits you.~
@1002 = ~Lord? Well, I shall call you my lord for a whole day, then! You surely deserve it, haha!~
@1003 = ~Lady? Well, I shall call you my lady for a whole day, then! You surely deserve it, haha!~
@1004 = ~Excuse me? Haha! That's a good one. Well, you named it! Today, I shall call you Your Highest Emanation of Sexiness. Haha!~
@1005 = ~Sir? Well, I shall call you sir for a whole day, then! You surely deserve it, haha!~
@1006 = ~Ma'am? Well, I shall call you ma'am for a whole day, then! You surely deserve it, haha!~
@1007 = ~Eh, perhaps you're right. I shouldn't take any more of your time.~
@1008 = ~I mentioned Jackly before, remember? That other slave who helped me when I first got locked up in a cell. He would always say: "Hope is more than a wish, it can reshape your actions. Unfortunately, so can doubt." I think I agree with him. I can't imagine doing all this work without hope.~
@1009 = ~How do you understand it?~
@1010 = ~We don't have time for this. Let's just go.~
@1011 = ~We have to face terrible situations every day. I can't imagine doing it without the conviction that what we do matters. That we can turn the tables for someone, ease their pain or inspire them. Luckily, hope seems to run in my veins, at least that's what my mother used to say. I suppose she meant I don't give up easily. Others, though, would just call it stubbornness. Perhaps it's actually a mix of both.~
@1012 = ~Doubt, on the other hand, is like... venom? Or a little woodworm, slowly weakening you when you don't even notice, leaving these empty holes, all until you shatter into splinters.~
@1013 = ~Hope can do much. It can make us believe we're going to get this... Irenicus. Help you. Help those you care about. Stop his plans from coming to fruition. And that in the end, we'll have a proper feast!~
@1014 = ~We need hope, I agree. Without it... well, victory may be hard to achieve. If not impossible.~
@1015 = ~I'm not sure if I'd give all the credit to hope. It's also hard work, a keen mind, a dose of luck, and perhaps, strong will and wits.~
@1016 = ~I don't know if I still have that much hope. I'm no longer sure that we're going to survive this mission. It certainly seems suicidal.~
@1017 = ~We don't have any more time. Let's just go.~
@1018 = ~True, true.~
@1019 = ~Oh, we're collecting all of these now? Heh. Hope is the main ingredient, perhaps... at least for me. But I wouldn't mind getting some more luck or wits. Heh.~
@1020 = ~Come on, don't be so pessimistic. I'd share some hope with you if it was drinkable, but... perhaps it will be enough if I tell you I can see we're getting better and better at this. That's a sign we can actually win.~
@1021 = ~There's something else, too. I hope that we won't be entangled in this chain of fights forever. But I do hope we'll continue discussing and reflecting on... things. Many things. Not just virtues, but... bread? What makes an apple good? Or what makes men handsome? I mean, is it muscles? The mind? Or maybe their spirit? Once I know, I'll be able to plan what to work on next, heh.~
@1022 = ~The point is—we're doing many things here. I guess. And I like all of them. Not just the "help everyone" part, but also the exchange of thoughts or... weird questions. That can be entertaining and pleasant, too.~
@1023 = ~That's the reason why I'm not doing this alone, Eddard.~
@1024 = ~Look, I know you have high hopes about us bonding, but we're here for a job, so... hold your horses.~
@1025 = ~Right. Well, that makes sense. And... I suppose I'm glad it does.~
@1026 = ~Anyway, it was nice talking to you. Thanks.~
@1027 = ~I... I see you don't want to talk. Fine. I suppose...~
@1028 = ~We're stopping? That's great, because... I've been thinking about something.~
@1029 = ~I'm all ears.~
@1030 = ~We're stopping because we need to rest. So... please, not right now. Just let me have some sleep.~
@1031 = ~A friend of mine taught me how to paint signs and symbols on the skin with this special ink. It's something between warpaint and a tattoo. It's not permanent, but it should last for a week or two. I have some of that ink left—perhaps you'd like to be my canvas to<DAYNIGHT>, hmm?~
@1032 = ~Sure! That sounds like fun.~
@1033 = ~I... admire the fact you'd offer me such a thing, but that's not for me. I'm really sorry.~
@1034 = ~No, I'm not interested. I'd rather get some sleep than waste time with you, Eddard.~
@1035 = ~Good! I can draw something, but... you need to tell me where.~
@1036 = ~On my hand, perhaps?~
@1037 = ~On my arm, perhaps?~
@1038 = ~On my neck, perhaps?~
@1039 = ~On my chest, perhaps?~
@1040 = ~On my belly, perhaps?~
@1041 = ~On my calf, perhaps?~
@1042 = ~On my feet, perhaps?~
@1043 = ~On my thigh, perhaps?~
@1044 = ~You know what? I... changed my mind. That's... not for me.~
@1045 = ~Hand it is, then! That will be my chance to give it a good look. (wink)~
@1046 = ~Arm it is, then! That will be my chance to give it a good look. (wink)~
@1047 = ~Neck it is, then! Let me see it. I'll be gentle since it's a difficult area to play with. (wink)~
@1048 = ~Chest it is, then! Hmm, I didn't know it would include undressing, but... why not. It may be a good place to work with. (wink)~
@1049 = ~Belly it is, then! Hmm, that may be interesting... and a kind of challenge. Perhaps I'll start here, and then I'll go under the navel. That may be a chance to see how you're treating yourself, too. (wink)~
@1050 = ~Calf it is, then! That will be my chance to give it a good look. (wink)~
@1051 = ~Feet it is, then! That will be my chance to give them a good look. I'll be careful, I heard some people have sensitive feet. (wink)~
@1052 = ~Thigh it is, then! That's not a usual place, but... I like it. (wink)~
@1053 = ~You may be surprised, but while I enjoyed my physical training, the swordsmanship lessons, I also enjoyed the history of art. I once asked my parents for this book on the art of Chult.~
@1054 = ~I've seen people practicing skin art there too. And in Calimshan. Actually, there are a couple places in the realms where it got popular for many reasons. It is worn during battles or to celebrate some events. It can be part of a bonding ritual. Sometimes, it's even used to summon spirits or amplify magic skills.~
@1055 = ~This world can be truly intriguing—wait, I may need a smaller brush now. Almost like a needle. Now... a few final details.~
@1056 = ~Art takes many forms, I suppose. That's why I like it. Its forms can be just as diverse as people of the realms.~
@1057 = ~And... it's done. Keep it like that for a few hours, and then you can use a wet cloth to clean it. The tint of your skin will be darker in the place where the ink was.~
@1058 = ~Perhaps you could help me clean it later.~
@1059 = ~Thank you, Eddard. That's not something I've done before.~
@1060 = ~It looks really good. It is truly... unusual. And nice.~
@1061 = ~Such a waste of time. I regret letting you do this to me.~
@1062 = ~I... suppose it looks fine.~
@1063 = ~I... I can. If you want me to. It may be... nice to finish off the process...~
@1064 = ~I'm glad you like it. And it was a pleasure to work on it... and to have a closer look at you. But I should leave you now. I'm sure you'd like to have some sleep.~
@1065 = ~Well, it's always nice to try new things. Even if they're not something you'd like to do again. Thank you for your patience in the whole process and... for giving it a try.~
@1066 = ~I understand. That's not something I would insist you try, so... perhaps we'll just talk next time we have a moment.~
@1067 = ~Well, I'm sorry I bothered you, then.~
@1068 = ~It's been a while since I read something from my favorite genre...~
@1069 = ~What would it be, I wonder?~
@1070 = ~We don't have time for this. Go and find a book club if that's what you want to talk about.~
@1071 = ~I bet you'd take me for an enthusiast of heroic books, right? I... may surprise you, but my favorite genre is a combination of horror and romance.~
@1072 = ~Oh, that's quite interesting!~
@1073 = ~Is that a thing? I didn't even know it existed.~
@1074 = ~I must admit, you've got my attention...~
@1075 = ~Eddard, if you want to talk about books, go and find yourself a book club.~
@1076 = ~I especially loved "The Haunting of Greenglaive" by Homleen Fallhood. It's about two brothers, Fepplick and Dalamagh, who return to their manor near the fictional village of Valamman after their mother's passing. They want to sell their house and return to their wives, but as they stay, they start to see these... glimpses of the future mixed with nightmares.~
@1077 = ~One of them falls in love with a maid who was taking care of the mansion while they were traveling to Valamman. He tells himself that it's because he loves that mysterious aura she has, but it's actually because his marriage is based on lies. The more of these visions he sees, the more he understands it. His brother, however, is mortified, as there is this chamber, his old room, in which an eyeless ghost roams every night, and can't find a way to free himself from a family curse.~
@1078 = ~It's actually an allegory of facing the truth and your doubts and clinging to the unsatisfying reality that can never get us truly happy, but—I suppose I've already recapped the first few chapters for you. Sorry. I just really like it and... I'd like to read something like that.~
@1079 = ~Hey, it's fine! I just... didn't know you're a book fan.~
@1080 = ~It actually sounds pretty amazing, and I'd love to read it one day.~
@1081 = ~If you want to talk about books, go and find someone else. That's not my cup of tea.~
@1082 = ~Why? Because a hunk can't read horror romances? (wink) Hah, I'm joking, I... I suppose I wouldn't expect myself to be a bookworm if I were you. It's fine.~
@1083 = ~Oh, you really should! It's worth all that time and effort of getting it.~
@1084 = ~You see, the Silvershield estate could be quite... lonely. And boring. That's why I liked such books. Because they let me feel the things I missed in my everyday life. And they inspired these games—Skie and I pretended that one of the estate's floors was haunted...~
@1085 = ~Wait... are you talking about "Grooms & Skulls"? That game we came up with? Quite morbid, but I could wear this black dress, oh, I QUITE liked it! Not sure if I'd wear it now, but it served its purpose.~
@1086 = ~Yes, that was the game, heh. I'm surprised you remember it.~
@1087 = ~Oh, do you REALLY think I'd forget how you wanted to be the husband of Mr. Skull, that ghost we made—~
@1088 = ~Skie! Leave some of these embarrassing stories to me, so I have something to share on my deathbed.~
@1089 = ~Fine, fine... but you're taking SO MUCH fun away from me!~
@1090 = ~Right. Where was I...? Ah!~
@1091 = ~That obviously annoyed our parents as Skie and I covered the windows to give the mansion that spooky feel. But that was just another way of forgetting the boring reality of classes, diplomacy, and being the "paragon of virtues and modesty" I was forced to be...~
@1092 = ~I can imagine little Eddard and Skie being PAINFULLY creative. And just waiting to kill some time or sneak out of the mansion.~
@1093 = ~I suppose that's exactly what I would expect from bored kids locked in a big house with their boring parents.~
@1094 = ~It sounds like the two of you had your ways of escaping your daily routines.~
@1095 = ~Whatever. We need to move on. Now. Stop causing these delays.~
@1096 = ~Skie learned how to escape quite soon. And then she taught me some bits.~
@1097 = ~Well, that sounds like a horror too. But... I suppose it seems worse than it truly was. At least we were safe.~
@1098 = ~Heh, those were different times. But I would still read something from the genre. Maybe it's nostalgia talking through me, but hey—what can I do, right?~
@1099 = ~I can't say that was very nice and understanding of you.~
@1100 = ~Well, you surely don't waste your time. We rarely stay too long in one place and—that's good. It means we won't get bored. Even if it also means tackling all these tasks that keep appearing before us.~
@1101 = ~But that's fine with you.~
@1102 = ~It's better than what you'd have back home.~
@1103 = ~I'd rather do the work than a hundred push-ups every day.~
@1104 = ~Mhm. Our life will get even richer if you stop slowing us down all the time.~
@1105 = ~Oh, I like it. I mean... the pace. And everything. And you're a good leader.~
@1106 = ~Sorry, I'm probably babbling. Let's just move on. I need to think about something.~
@1107 = ~Haha, true, true. So very true. But...~
@1108 = ~Never mind. Sorry, I'm probably babbling. Let's just move on. I need to think about something.~
@1109 = ~Right. I will bother you no longer.~
@1110 = ~You know, last time I kind of cut our talk short because I felt like it wasn't the right time. I had to cool my head, so we could talk honestly. No games or anything like that.~
@1111 = ~Is something wrong?~
@1112 = ~I don't have time for this. We should move on.~
@1113 = ~Quite the opposite. The thing is, I like you. You're a good leader, and not just that. A person I care about. And... I sort of can't stop wondering if you'd let me kiss you. I don't know if you feel the same way, so I thought I'd simply ask. Just... to be sure.~
@1114 = ~I'm not sure if we'd be a good pair, but... I suppose one kiss wouldn't hurt.~
@1115 = ~I've noticed that you like talking to me, and I had this feeling it may be about something... else. I don't want to name it just yet, though.~
@1116 = ~I was hoping you'd ask, Eddard. I think I like you, and talking to you often makes my day. That is a yes, by the way.~
@1117 = ~Sorry, but... no. I don't look at you that way.~
@1118 = ~(He comes closer and leans gently, kissing your lips. The kiss isn't long, but it gives you a chance to feel him better. He's strong. His skin has the scent of sweet pears and nutmeg.)~
@1119 = ~I... heh...~
@1120 = ~What?~
@1121 = ~What's wrong? Did I do something?~
@1122 = ~I'm sorry, Eddard, but... I don't feel it. I just don't.~
@1123 = ~No, it's... it's better than I thought. Sorry, it's okay to say something like that, right?~
@1124 = ~Heh. Yes, it's fine. Everything is fine. That I can tell you.~
@1125 = ~Good, I thought I did something stupid or that I have bad breath.~
@1126 = ~I'm sorry, Eddard, but I don't feel it.~
@1127 = ~So, do you want to repeat that? (smiles mischievously and bites his lip)~
@1128 = ~Wait... were the two of you kissing, or am I sleepwalking? Like... SERIOUSLY?~
@1129 = ~Skie, give us some space! Please.~
@1130 = ~But I WANNA KNOW...~
@1131 = ~Don't expect to know everything. It's... just a kiss.~
@1132 = ~I KNEW IT! I was afraid you were a clumsy kisser and that some may find it—~
@1133 = ~SKIE!~
@1134 = ~Okay, okay. I'll go and watch the scene from over there...~
@1135 = ~Just joking... You're not the only one in the family who can joke, you know.~
@1136 = ~I. BEG. YOU.~
@1137 = ~Ugh... Fine, fine. I'll leave you be.~
@1138 = ~<CHARNAME>... I'm... really sorry for her. She can be so NOSY. So, about the kiss.~
@1139 = ~I wouldn't mind stealing another one from you.~
@1140 = ~That's certainly an option.~
@1141 = ~I think we should talk. If you don't mind.~
@1142 = ~You know what? I just realized... that I can't do this. This is a bad idea. I'm sorry, Eddard. You may need to look for a company elsewhere.~
@1143 = ~Heh. Good to know. (kisses you again, you can feel his chest moving as he breathes)~
@1144 = ~There...~
@1145 = ~I think we should see where this is going to lead us. If you're up for it.~
@1146 = ~I hope this experiment isn't going to end just yet. I think we should give it a chance.~
@1147 = ~You know, Eddard, I... don't think it's going to work. That's not... it.~
@1148 = ~Hmm? What would you like to talk about?~
@1149 = ~I've been watching you for a while and I sensed this may happen. I think we should give it a chance.~
@1150 = ~I thought we should make it clear: I'd like to see where this is going to lead us. If that's what you want, too.~
@1151 = ~Let's just see how it goes. I know we're leading a dangerous life, and sometimes it's hard to tell where fate will take us. Still, as long as we're not hurting anyone, we can enjoy whatever this is going to be.~
@1152 = ~We don't need to label it, it's not an alchemist fire bottle that could potentially burn us alive. So let's just have some rest now see what happens next.~
@1153 = ~Right.~
@1154 = ~That makes sense. It's not like we're promising each other anything.~
@1155 = ~That's... not for me. Sorry. We should end it before it truly starts.~
@1156 = ~Good. Rest well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1157 = ~Mhm. Right. I think that's... clear.~
@1158 = ~Everything is suddenly much more clear.~
@1159 = ~(You wake up before everybody else. When you start folding your covers, you notice that Eddard has kicked off his blanket in his sleep and lies there almost completely naked. He wakes up and yawns. Then, he realizes he has uncovered himself and tries to nervously pull up the blanket... as if it wasn't too late.)~
@1160 = ~Gods...! I... well... that means... I don't have much more to hide from you. Sorry. The night was too warm for my taste... and...~
@1161 = ~No worries. It's not like you have something I haven't seen. Heh.~
@1162 = ~Well, it's not like you're the first man I saw naked. Don't worry. (wink)~
@1163 = ~You looked kinda adorable. So vulnerable. Like a sleeping puppy.~
@1164 = ~No need to be embarrassed. We all have our bodies and yours looks fine. Just in case you didn't know.~
@1165 = ~Please, try to... control yourself next time. Or should we buy you a thinner blanket?~
@1166 = ~You know what? It's not like there will be a better moment, so we should talk now, before we set off. I thought about our conversation, and it's not going to work. Sorry.~
@1167 = ~It looks like you're having quite some fun. Look, I... uhm. Well... that's me. Sorry. At least I wasn't scratching myself or something. Not sure if that would be even MORE embarrassing, but—you know, I'll just shut up. That's the best thing I can do.~
@1168 = ~Erm... thank you? And... sorry about... all of that? At least I wasn't scratching myself or something. Not sure if that would be even MORE embarrassing, but—you know, I'll just shut up. That's the best thing I can do.~
@1169 = ~YES. Thank you.~
@1170 = ~Now, excuse me, I need to at least put my pants on. Right. Now. (Eddard stands up and puts his pants on, still looking a bit embarrassed. Then he just stands with his hands on his hips, clearly trying to look as if nothing happened)~
@1171 = ~Again, I apologize. I rarely feel cold and... I got used to cold nights back when I was locked up in a cell. It's more comfortable now and—I'm babbling again.~
@1172 = ~Calm down. Really.~
@1173 = ~It's okay. Do you want something to eat?~
@1174 = ~I'd rather you at least wear something, so I don't need to feel awkward next time it happens...~
@1175 = ~We need to talk. It's not like there will be a better moment, so we might as well do it now, before we set off. I thought about our conversation, and it's not going to work. Sorry.~
@1176 = ~Okay. I didn't want to make you feel weird. That's my main concern, but you do seem fine...~
@1177 = ~Eat? Erm, sure. I'm starving actually.~
@1178 = ~And... thanks. For not making it weirder than it already is. Was. It's in the past.~
@1179 = ~I've been sleeping much better lately. After you freed me, I started feeling better and safer soon. But now, when more time has passed, I can finally say I'm truly over what happened to me. The way I feel now is what I was striving for all along, even if I didn't realize at first. It feels right.~
@1180 = ~I'm glad. No wonder it took you a while, though.~
@1181 = ~Well, I just had a demonstration of how safe you feel, hah.~
@1182 = ~Look... wait. There's something else I want to talk about. It's not like there will be a better moment, so we can do it now, before we set off. I thought about our conversation, and it's not going to work. Sorry.~
@1183 = ~Right. Again, sorry.~
@1184 = ~It's just... I've been sleeping much better lately. After you freed me, I started feeling better and safer soon. But now, when more time has passed, I can finally say I'm truly over what happened to me. The way I feel now is what I was striving for all along, even if I didn't realize at first. It feels right.~
@1185 = ~That's good news. I'm glad you're truly better. No wonder it took you a while, though.~
@1186 = ~Well, I just had a demonstration of how safe you feel...~
@1187 = ~Look... wait. Just wait. There's something else I want to talk about. It's not like there will be a better moment, so we might as well do it now, before we set off. I thought about our conversation , and it's not going to work. Sorry.~
@1188 = ~Please, don't make me apologize again...~
@1189 = ~If we could ignore the recent... happening for a moment, I suppose I feel SO much safer. That's also thanks to you. So thank you. This group seems like a bunch of... really interesting people. But you leading us—it just feels right.~
@1190 = ~Yes. And I suppose that's also thanks to you. So thank you. This group feels like a bunch of... really interesting people. But you leading us—it just feels right.~
@1191 = ~No wonder people call you a hero. However, I guess we've had enough of the NAKED truth for one hour so, let me go and collect my things. I suppose we should move on soon.~
@1192 = ~Eat something good, we may need a lot of energy for today's work. I'll be waiting for you over there.~
@1193 = ~I... I see. Well, I'm glad you told me. Thank you. Let's pretend that... none of this happened, then.~
@1194 = ~<CHARNAME>. I know sometimes our work makes some days seem longer than they are. So I made something for you.~
@1195 = ~Is that a sandwich?~
@1196 = ~I don't have time for this. We should move on. You're wasting too much of my time.~
@1197 = ~Yes. And it's not an apology sandwich for the last time, I swear. I know it may look like this , but it's actually something else.~
@1198 = ~I remember a time when my father was really worried about some event in the city. I'm not sure what it was, but he was working day and night. He rarely ate. He got pale, and even his eyes seemed different. As if they were tired. Skie made him a sandwich... and for a moment he felt better. Stronger. And he really ate it.~
@1199 = ~You're up to your ears in duties, too, and I wanted to do something for you. I'm not a good cook, so I thought it would be better to prepare something simple rather than a fancy treat that could give you food poisoning. And here it is: a cheese sandwich. Simple, but should give you some energy.~
@1200 = ~Thanks. I was actually quite hungry.~
@1201 = ~That's adorable. Thank you.~
@1202 = ~I... don't want it. Sorry, but... just give me a break.~
@1203 = ~Go and eat it yourself. You're wasting too much of my time.~
@1204 = ~Just remember to chew it well! It would be a pity if the Hero of Baldur's Gate, the slayer of monsters and demons, got defeated by a snack.~
@1205 = ~Anyway, I hope this will be a good day and that it will get us one step closer to Irenicus and the victory we all long for.~
@1206 = ~Sorry for the imposition, then...~
@1207 = ~I have an idea you may like, <CHARNAME>. Let's play a little game, what do you say? I'll name two things, and you'll pick the one you prefer. You know, dogs and cats. It's simple, and perhaps I'll learn something new about you!~
@1208 = ~I like the idea. Let's do this.~
@1209 = ~I am sorry, Eddard, I do like you, but... I really dislike this game. It trivializes things.~
@1210 = ~No. Eddard, this... isn't working out. I'm sorry, but we need to end this.~
@1211 = ~Mhm. Let's start then!~
@1212 = ~Moon or sun.~
@1213 = ~Moon!~
@1214 = ~Sun!~
@1215 = ~Good to know. That's my choice, too. The next one...~
@1216 = ~Sun? Intriguing. The next one...~
@1217 = ~Shore or forest?~
@1218 = ~Shore, I think.~
@1219 = ~I'll go for the forest.~
@1220 = ~Forest on the shore!~
@1221 = ~And that's cheating.~
@1222 = ~Then I say... shore.~
@1223 = ~Fine, I'll go with the forest.~
@1224 = ~Give me another one, then.~
@1225 = ~Pub or library.~
@1226 = ~Pub.~
@1227 = ~Library.~
@1228 = ~It looks like someone likes to party. Next one.~
@1229 = ~A hunger for knowledge, hmm? That can be intriguing, too. Next one.~
@1230 = ~Evening with a book or investigating a dungeon?~
@1231 = ~Hmm, a book. I'd like to rest a bit.~
@1232 = ~Investigating a dungeon, of course!~
@1233 = ~Hah. Well, you've been busy lately, so I'm not surprised.~
@1234 = ~Hah, well, somehow I'm not surprised, "<PRO_LORDLADY> adventurer".~
@1235 = ~And finally: a kiss on the neck or a backrub? Focus as that's an important one.~
@1236 = ~A kiss.~
@1237 = ~Oh, I would kill for a backrub.~
@1238 = ~I really want both. Perhaps from a handsome and strong hunk? (grin)~
@1239 = ~Please, stop... Eddard, it's... not working out. I'm sorry, it's... just not it.~
@1240 = ~Hah, so we know what we're going to do the next time we set up camp or stay at an inn.~
@1241 = ~Look, I know the game is quite silly, but I'm just looking for new ways of learning more about you. Also, I thought if we fool around a bit, so you won't feel overwhelmed with our job and Irenicus. I wouldn't be surprised if you had dreams about him or about the things he could do. So I thought a little game, even if silly, may help.~
@1242 = ~Yes. It was simple, but... at least it was something else.~
@1243 = ~The most important thing is that I appreciate the effort.~
@1244 = ~It didn't, I'm afraid. I just can't stop thinking about the things he did and things he can still... do.~
@1245 = ~Eddard, it's... it's... not working out. I'm sorry. We need to end this.~
@1246 = ~It was.~
@1247 = ~Heh. What a diplomatic reply...~
@1248 = ~I know. But I also know we can't think about him all the time.~
@1249 = ~Now, all jokes aside. I want to ask you, in all seriousness, <CHARNAME>—how are you truly feeling?~
@1250 = ~Fine. Perhaps just a bit tired.~
@1251 = ~Could be better, could be worse.~
@1252 = ~Could be better. It's all quite hard...~
@1253 = ~I'm in this mood or state when... I can no longer tell, to be honest.~
@1254 = ~Fine. I'm fine.~
@1255 = ~Eddard, it's... it's... not working out. Just leave me alone. I want to be alone.~
@1256 = ~Are you sure? I'll respect your decision... no matter what it's going to be.~
@1257 = ~Yes. We should end this.~
@1258 = ~No, I just need some time. Let's talk again soon. Just... give me a moment.~
@1259 = ~I hear you. Thank you for telling me.~
@1260 = ~Know that you can talk to me. No matter how you feel.~
@1261 = ~Good. I'm glad to hear that. Know that you can talk to me. No matter how you feel.~
@1262 = ~Now... let's get going. I'll try to help you relax when we stop.~
@1263 = ~Sure. I get it. Never mind then.~
@1264 = ~As you wish. We'll talk some other time.~
@1265 = ~I understand... I... I'll leave you be, then.~
@1266 = ~The more we work, the more I realize how... lonely we were in our house. Skie and me.~
@1267 = ~What do you mean? Why are you just seeing it now?~
@1268 = ~Do you really think I care? Sorry, but I have more important things on my mind right now.~
@1269 = ~We've met so many people I can barely count. People of all ages and races, each with their own heritage, status, and reputation. Back home, we only got to see the same few figures all the time, like our teachers and father's co-workers or counselors. Most of them shared the same "proper" manners or even speaking patterns. Here I can see that this world is richer than I ever imagined. I know, I talked about diverse people before, when... I offered you my skin art, but back then, my knowledge came only from books.~
@1270 = ~Now I even doubt any of my sources described it all well enough. Since we started working together I must have seen like seventy types of traders, heard dozens of greetings, and met men and women that turned out to be so much more than one would expect.~
@1271 = ~And it makes me... sad.~
@1272 = ~Sad? Shouldn't you be happy?~
@1273 = ~I'm not sure if I understand where this is coming from, Eddard.~
@1274 = ~You feel as if you weren't told the truth about the world?~
@1275 = ~Look, we don't have time for this. We should be moving instead of wasting time our breath on idle chatters.~
@1276 = ~It's—I feel as if part of reality was hidden from us. Perhaps on purpose? Or out of... fear?~
@1277 = ~Yes. And no. I feel as if part of reality was hidden from us. Perhaps on purpose? Or out of... fear?~
@1278 = ~Wouldn't we be better prepared for the roles they wanted us to play if we knew the world as it was? They could still teach us the "important" stuff, but we could also... feel things! Experience them. I... I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to understand it.~
@1279 = ~Sorry, you have nothing to do with this, but... I thought I could talk to you about my... observation.~
@1280 = ~We can talk about anything you want. And yes, I agree. They should have shown you this world. Or at least more of its shades.~
@1281 = ~Look, they did it because they were worried about you. Some people claim that children internalize bad habits or unwanted knowledge way too easily. They may have been trying to avoid that.~
@1282 = ~Eddard, we can't waste time on the past and things we can't change. Ugh... I think I need some space. You're giving me a headache.~
@1283 = ~Mhm. That's exactly what I mean...~
@1284 = ~Maybe, but... somehow it still seems unfair.~
@1285 = ~I suppose that's how it works with families like mine. And that's the part that makes me worried what my life would be if I were to return and stay at the estate. I'm not changing my mind, I will still step up and help my city when my father has no more strength to do it, but I'd like all of it to be more honest. And I don't want to repeat their mistakes. Or stop noticing those mistakes because I get used to the "noble reality".~
@1286 = ~Here, though, I can feel more free than I ever have. Definitely more than when I was captured. And more than I felt back home.~
@1287 = ~I feel the same. Candlekeep was a... challenging place. For reasons similar to those you mentioned, actually.~
@1288 = ~Eddard, we can't waste time on the past and things we can't ever change. Look, this... isn't working. Please, just let us move on and... sorry.~
@1289 = ~Really?~
@1290 = ~Yes. There were rules there, and the Great Library, those routines, chores. And I rarely saw anyone from the outside. Mostly the same faces. Winthrop. Imoen. Gorion. Hull. Tethoril. So I too felt as if I was stuck in this... puddle of grease that wouldn't let me move.~
@1291 = ~Well, partially. Gorion was a demanding man. Sometimes I felt like he didn't want me to have any free time, so he gave me those chores and lessons. I know he wanted to prepare me for this life, but he also took something away from me. Sadly, that's how it feels.~
@1292 = ~No. I... I don't know. But I can imagine how you felt. How it must have been hard for a boy to grow up constrained by courtesies and expectations. I think it would scare me.~
@1293 = ~Eddard, we don't have time to talk about the past. Look, this... isn't working. Please, just let us move on and... I'm sorry, this is how I feel.~
@1294 = ~Mmm. Perhaps that's why we understand each other so well. Even though our experiences were so different. But that's good. It makes it all more... real.~
@1295 = ~It's good to know how you feel. Well, I won't waste any more of your time and attention. Excuse me.~
@1296 = ~The last time we talked, I might have been in lower spirits. But I hope we can spend some more time together. If you'd like that, of course. I don't want to impose.~
@1297 = ~I'll gladly spend more time with you, Eddard. I'm always up for it.~
@1298 = ~Of course. I... suppose I can take care of other things later. Sit. Let's talk.~
@1299 = ~Eddard, I was going to talk to you anyway. I don't think it's working out. We should end this. It's not leading us where I thought it would.~
@1300 = ~Thank you. It's... I've been thinking about you and how we talk... How we can trust each other. Not just in battle, but also day to day. We can discuss our thoughts and feelings, and...~
@1301 = ~Look, about that. I don't think it's working out. We should end this. It's not leading us where I thought it would.~
@1302 = ~I know we were to see if this relationship can actually work, and to me, it does. And I've been thinking—when we talked at first... we didn't promise each other anything. We weren't binding each other in any way. But now... do you think we can continue as a real couple? I just don't know if I want to get deeper into this if we're not on the same page. So I'd like us to be together. The two of us.~
@1303 = ~I think I'd like that.~
@1304 = ~I think we're already heading in that direction.~
@1305 = ~I'm sorry, but monogamous relationships are not for me.~
@1306 = ~Eddard, it's... not working out for me. I don't feel the same way you do. Sorry.~
@1307 = ~Heh. Well... it all feels so much lighter already. I was afraid you'd say something else. That you're not feeling it.~
@1308 = ~(He leans towards you slowly, clearly wanting to kiss you.)~
@1309 = ~(Kiss him.)~
@1310 = ~Wait... no. Sorry. I lied. I want to feel the same way, but I don't. I'm sorry, but I don't think we can make it work.~
@1311 = ~(Your lips meet one more time. Now, however, Eddard seems more serious about everything. About how he feels. And his kiss reflects that. He's quieter, but the kiss is more confident. He holds you tight and you can feel how his body reacts to you and what you said. There's no trace of guilt or uncertainty about what the two of you are.)~
@1312 = ~I want to be with you. Let me, please.~
@1313 = ~I want it too, you don't need to worry.~
@1314 = ~Hah, I suppose you've been a good boy, so... come.~
@1315 = ~No. It doesn't feel right. I'm sorry.~
@1316 = ~No. I... no. Just no. I don't want it. I changed my mind.~
@1317 = ~(He doesn't reply. Instead, he takes off his clothes, revealing the version of himself you saw some time ago when he uncovered himself in his sleep... This time, however, he doesn't look embarrassed. He becomes a careful man, not the usual chaotic trickster.)~
@1318 = ~(He comes closer and helps you remove your clothes, revealing your chest, and soon leaving you with nothing else but your true self: a man of flesh and bones.)~
@1319 = ~(He comes closer and helps you remove your clothes, revealing your breasts, and soon leaving you with nothing else, but your true self: a woman of flesh and bones.)~
@1320 = ~(He kisses your neck while letting you sense him the way you want. The way you feel is fit for this situation. As time passes, the tension grows to the point where you can't hold yourself back.)~
@1321 = ~I see. It's good you made things clear before everything became even more serious.~
@1322 = ~You're awake...? (You can see his chest, still bare, move as he breathes. He looks at you and smiles subtly. He seems calm.)~
@1323 = ~Mmm. I am, I guess. How are you?~
@1324 = ~Still half-asleep. But I suppose I should ask if everything is fine. Are you all right?~
@1325 = ~No, clearly. But... Eddard, I think we need to talk. That... can't happen again. It didn't feel appropriate, we're on a mission, after all. A suicidal one.~
@1326 = ~I feel calm. It's been a while since—and it felt right. But it also proves everything can really be as it used to be. And I'm also happy that I learned that with you. (He touches your ear lightly and then hugs you. You can see he didn't put anything on. It looks like he truly feels comfortable with you and your closeness.)~
@1327 = ~Heh. I think I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1328 = ~I love you too.~
@1329 = ~I may need some more time to use that word, Eddard.~
@1330 = ~Eddard, I'm sorry, but... that doesn't make me feel comfortable. I'm sorry, but we need to end this. Better now than... later...~
@1331 = ~Eddard, I thought that we could just have some good time, but... it looks like it's something else for you. Sorry, but that's not what I want to have.~
@1332 = ~I'm happy to hear that. That means we're just with each other. In... that sense. Right...?~
@1333 = ~Of course.~
@1334 = ~Yes. I suppose we're together already.~
@1335 = ~Sorry, but... but monogamy isn't for me. If that's what you're looking for, then... sorry.~
@1336 = ~Of course, I... understand. (smiles) It's fine, it would be bizarre if people could synchronize feelings. So... whenever you're ready. When you feel it. But does it mean we can be together? Just with each other?~
@1337 = ~Of course we can.~
@1338 = ~Yes, Eddard. I suppose we're together already anyway.~
@1339 = ~Sorry, Eddard, but monogamy isn't for me. If that's what you're looking for, then... sorry.~
@1340 = ~(He kisses your arm. It seems that clarifying the situation allowed helped him calm down. He's also thankful that everything went as he hoped it would.)~
@1341 = ~I'm happy to be with a strong man like you. And I don't mean just physically strong.~
@1342 = ~I'm happy to be with a strong woman like you. And I don't mean just physically strong.~
@1343 = ~I suppose there's a lot I can learn from you!~
@1344 = ~Oh, I can certainly teach you a few things.~
@1345 = ~Mhm. Well, it's all very nice, but I think it's time to move on.~
@1346 = ~Like... you mean. THESE things? Gods, was I too... quick, or something? I hope not!~
@1347 = ~Haha! No, there are some tricks I could show you, though!~
@1348 = ~No, no. Haha. I meant... cooking. I could teach you how to cook. No worries, it won't hurt.~
@1349 = ~Oh, no, I meant other things. After all, our education paths were very different!~
@1350 = ~Never mind. Well, it's all very nice, but I think it's time to move on.~
@1351 = ~Uhm. Okay. I guess that could be interesting. I'll try to keep the right pace and focus, heh.~
@1352 = ~Come now. I suppose we should collect our things and get moving. (smiles)~
@1353 = ~Uhm. I suppose it's not a bad idea...~
@1354 = ~...and learning how to cook from a handsome man like you can be interesting. I hope I'll manage to keep my focus, though! (winks)~
@1355 = ~...and learning how to cook from a beautiful woman like you can be interesting. I hope I'll manage to keep my focus, though! (winks)~
@1356 = ~Come now. I guess we should collect our things and get moving. (smiles)~
@1357 = ~Of course. I think I'd like that. (smiles)~
@1358 = ~Come now. Let's move until then. But I'll wait for those lessons.~
@1359 = ~Of course. Let me collect my things and... I may need to find my pants. But I should be ready soon.~
@1360 = ~I see... I suppose it's better to learn that now rather than find out a year later.~
@1361 = ~I... I see. I suppose I'm glad you told me. I wouldn't want you to force yourself into something you couldn't enjoy.~
@1362 = ~Since we're together, perhaps it won't sound as if I'm just fishing for a compliment... Would you mind telling me if you think I'm handsome? I suppose it's hard for a man to judge this by himself.~
@1363 = ~Well, of course, you are. (wink)~
@1364 = ~You look fine. You're different from those who usually catch my attention, but you're fit and good-looking. That's good.~
@1365 = ~I suppose. I... I don't know! It's... erm... a hard question!~
@1366 = ~I'm not sure I would use that exact adjective, Eddard, but don't take it personally.~
@1367 = ~You know what? I don't think we're a good match after all. I'm sorry, but we should end this. And don't ask me such questions again...~
@1368 = ~Huh. Somehow it's hard to believe someone you're sleeping with to be impartial about it, but hey, at least I know I'm your type. Thanks.~
@1369 = ~Ah, well. So I'm not exactly your type? Well, you're still sleeping with me so... I guess that's good. It means there's still something in me that makes you want this to happen. Heh. Thanks.~
@1370 = ~Okay, okay. I never wanted to make you feel confused or troubled. Sorry.~
@1371 = ~Huh! I just learned that you can be honest to the bone! But... I suppose that's good. You're still sleeping with me, so... I guess that's good too. It means there's still something in me that makes you want this to happen. Heh. Thanks.~
@1372 = ~I asked because there it seems like different times have different canons of beauty and... I know how it may sound, but when I was growing up, I was a bit self-conscious. I wanted to be the type of person people find attractive. Handsome. Of course, it's not the most important part of life, but knowing people consider you good-looking provokes this... nice tingling.~
@1373 = ~I may sound silly. Ugh, sorry. I guess we all have that vain side sometimes.~
@1374 = ~And what do you think about me?~
@1375 = ~It's fine. I suppose it's normal that some part of us want to appeal to other people.~
@1376 = ~I think that's something we should avoid. Vanity can be corrupting. Perhaps even deadly.~
@1377 = ~Pardon my language, but you look DAMN good. Heh.~
@1378 = ~Right. It's good I have such an understanding significant other! Heh.~
@1379 = ~I know... I'll keep that part of me on a leash. I promise.~
@1380 = ~Appearance was also important in court life. People would comment on it, spend much gold and effort to look younger or emphasize their unique features. A lock of white hair. A "beauty spot", as they called it. Some would show off their scars, mostly men proud of the battles they fought. But I also knew a lady who did the same.~
@1381 = ~But I suppose I care mostly about what you think, feel, and tell me. I'm happy to hear your opinion. No matter what it is.~
@1382 = ~That... was sudden. I'm sorry if I angered you, and... I will no longer bother you then.~
@1383 = ~Fighting by your side is... the kind of experience that could make even a fine soul stronger.~
@1384 = ~And you're such a soul, hmm?~
@1385 = ~I think your soul is strong enough even without my help.~
@1386 = ~Please, we don't have time for things like that. We should move on.~
@1387 = ~With you? I feel good enough to say... yes. Yes, I am. (smiles)~
@1388 = ~I just wanted to tell you that. But I suppose we should get back to work.~
@1389 = ~Mmm. Maybe. But everything seems lighter when you're around.~
@1390 = ~I just thought I'd let you know. Heh.~
@1391 = ~I'm sorry. Heh. I just couldn't resist.~
@1392 = ~This place is so big, and it has this majestic feel. No wonder knights inspire so many tales. Isn't this place twice as big as the Silvershield estate?~
@1393 = ~It surely is big.~
@1394 = ~I never liked such places. They feel way too... radiant.~
@1395 = ~I think it's beautiful and, yes, somehow it seems even bigger..~
@1396 = ~We don't have time for talks. We should move on.~
@1397 = ~Is that all you have to say? Well, you are being a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of a few words today. Or... at least now.~
@1398 = ~Ah, you find the quarters of the Order of the RADIANT Heart too radiant? Heh. Sometimes you can be quite funny, <CHARNAME>. But that's okay.~
@1399 = ~And look at these high ceilings. They create the impression of an open space.~
@1400 = ~You know, there were times when I thought about becoming a paladin myself. I suppose my father would have liked that, but I always wanted to know more. I felt I should possess the basics of magic and the grasp of the written and spoken lore... That's how I ended up who I am today.~
@1401 = ~Who knows what I would have decided if I had visited a place like this in my early years, though.~
@1402 = ~I think you made a good choice. Your knowledge and skills really helped us a couple of times.~
@1403 = ~Oh, that could have been an interesting adventure. Mastering swordsmanship, studying morals, learning how to smite evil and eventually becoming a knight. I think you'd like it.~
@1404 = ~I think only fools take this path and become knights who may feel strong but always hide behind the codex when a serious decision is to be made!~
@1405 = ~Mhm. Anyway, I think we need to move on, Eddard. Come.~
@1406 = ~Your words are kind. I'm glad my parents approved of me learning all these things, but... I think they'd also approve of my current path.~
@1407 = ~Those could have been interesting lessons, yes, and an interesting path...~
@1408 = ~You're being really harsh right now, and slightly unfair, if I may be honest with you.~
@1409 = ~Anyway, I suppose we came here for a reason, not just for sightseeing, so excuse this little digression. If you want to move on, I'll be right behind you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1410 = ~Right. Of course. I should have remembered we're doing something. I'm sorry.~
@1411 = ~Wow. This is probably... the dirties tavern I have ever seen!~
@1412 = ~Welcome to the Copper Coronet. Heh.~
@1413 = ~Dirty? Oh, I wouldn't call it that. Just... heavily exploited.~
@1414 = ~Anyway, there's a reason for us being here. Come.~
@1415 = ~It's a unique view, that I can say!~
@1416 = ~Many of these people also seem "heavily exploited".~
@1417 = ~It doesn't exactly look like the Blade and Stars, Helm and Cloak, or even the Blushing Mermaid. Actually, even the latter seems like an expensive and posh place compared to where we are now.~
@1418 = ~Don't get me wrong, I don't mind staying here for a while. I'll feel like a scholar trying to find out how, by all the gods, this place still functions.~
@1419 = ~You REALLY don't mind staying here...? Gods, what did the last year to you, poor brother! You seem to have lost all standards...~
@1420 = ~I feel that if I make another step, my foot will stick to the floor forever, and I'll have to cut it off! Bleh!~
@1421 = ~Well, let's hope this time curiosity won't kill the cat!~
@1422 = ~Did you have a favorite tavern in Baldur's Gate?~
@1423 = ~Whatever. I think we should move on. Come, Eddard.~
@1424 = ~Hmm, not really. I mean, I don't think I can answer that question as I haven't been to many of them. Mostly because father considered it inappropriate. Eh...~
@1425 = ~So you weren't allowed to visit a tavern or a pub?!~
@1426 = ~I'm not sure how that would work. Were you chained to the wall or something?~
@1427 = ~We need to go, we don't have time to continue this talk. Let's move.~
@1428 = ~Hah. Well... it was... complicated.~
@1429 = ~When I was a kid, I could never go to such places, but most kids are kept away from pubs, right? They're not allowed to drink anyway, hmm?~
@1430 = ~Anyway, I was asked to stay away from them even when I was old enough to go. After many, many, many discussions, father and I reached a compromise. I could pick two or three nearby taverns I could go to once in a long while to ease my curiosity and the need to do something anywhere but not at the estate.~
@1431 = ~Don't get me wrong, my father knew I'd be responsible and not cause much trouble. I saw how he tried to accept I'm a grown man. But we should remember that people like to talk and make up stories. Also, father has some enemies. So... that also affected me. My life. But I made it. I got even older, stronger. As we can see today, I could be worse! I've done pretty well, considering the circumstances, heh.~
@1432 = ~But... wait, you are from Candlekeep, if I remember correctly, so it's not like you partied much yourself, hmm?~
@1433 = ~Well, we had an inn in Candlekeep! Called... Well... the Candlekeep Inn. Winthrop, the innkeeper didn't have any competition.~
@1434 = ~I never felt that I need to "party". I felt good doing other things, reading, or whatever else I was up for.~
@1435 = ~It doesn't matter. We should be going, Eddard, so... let's just move.~
@1436 = ~Oh, that's a creative name! Hah.~
@1437 = ~Hmm, that sounds nice. I know the options were limited, but...~
@1438 = ~Anyway, let's see what this... Copper Coronet hides? Mysteries? Cockroaches? Food made from things you'd normally never eat? I'm thinking the third option.~
@1439 = ~Mhm. Right. Right.~
@1440 = ~He's dead, and we have that orb. Maybe we'll be able to free these people. I'm sorry it took me a while to speak up, but... the idea we had to fight these slaves...~
@1441 = ~Such circumstances must be difficult for you.~
@1442 = ~Get a grip, Eddard. We're doing something here. You can't take it personally. This isn't the time.~
@1443 = ~They are. I mean, it's strange. But I know we don't have any other option. That is, we do now. That orb will help, I know it. And we certainly should use it.~
@1444 = ~Right. You're right. I'll... pull myself together.~
@1445 = ~Agh... hah. Well...! I didn't know we would... spend so much time here... I can't remember the last time... I spent so much time at a tavern or pub... hmm...~
@1446 = ~Oh, wow. You're really wasted, aren't you?~
@1447 = ~Uhm, you should know how to drink. And are your limits. Just... let us move on.~
@1448 = ~I thought you'd be more responsible when drinking. Well, let us move on.~
@1449 = ~Mmm... a tiny... bit? Oh, I thought it would be... nice! To feel like a normal guy. Getting... normally drunk. But... I might have... drunk one too many... Gods, I feel like I can take off my shirt and... do some brawling!~
@1450 = ~What?! No!~
@1451 = ~Hah. Well, I don't mind you taking that shirt off. But let's keep brawling off the list. (grin)~
@1452 = ~Well, do whatever you want.~
@1453 = ~Eh, let us just move on. You may need some fresh air.~
@1454 = ~Agh... you're such a killjoy to<DAYNIGHT>!~
@1455 = ~No, I'm not, and... who am I kidding. Arguing with a drunk person is getting us nowhere. We should just move on.~
@1456 = ~I liked the other idea more... I don't mind you taking that shirt off. But let's keep brawling off the list. (grin)~
@1457 = ~Well, do whatever you want. You're a big boy, I'm not going to tell you what to do.~
@1458 = ~Hah. I can't wait to see your face when you sober up and realize what you've been saying.~
@1459 = ~Oh... so... you like looking at me, hmm? Good... to know! The shirt's off... Fine... you can touch my chest! I know you want to...!~
@1460 = ~Haha! Well, I can already see how embarrassed you'll be when you get sober!~
@1461 = ~Well, it's... firm. You must work out quite a bit!~
@1462 = ~You know what? Let's go outside. You clearly need some fresh air.~
@1463 = ~I do push-ups! And... other things... And... mm. You have a nice hand. You can keep it on... my torso. If... you want. I... don't mind. Heh...~
@1464 = ~Heh. Well. I think you're about to pass out. You may need some fresh air.~
@1465 = ~Well, it's getting a bit uncomfortable. Let's just move on.~
@1466 = ~I... would do all that... But... I have that weird feeling in my stomach. And things are somehow... Well... I...~
@1467 = ~I may need some fresh air.~
@1468 = ~But I'll still look good... of course...! Hah...~
@1469 = ~Ugh... I may need some fresh air now...~
@1470 = ~Mhm... agh... right...~
@1471 = ~Uhm, look. I just realized I might have gotten a bit too drunk and... I remember a few things and I know I talked to you.~
@1472 = ~I don't know what exactly I said, but I think an apology is in order. So... sorry. Let's... pretend it was someone else you were talking to.~
@1473 = ~Now... I'll just go before you say anything. I'll be somewhere over there...~
@1474 = ~I read some things about the Underdark. Not only in textbooks written by scholars but also in novels. SOMEHOW, they were mostly horror stories. Huh. I wonder why...~
@1475 = ~Oh, I don't know. It's such a lovely place.~
@1476 = ~The Underdark is a dangerous place. We should ALWAYS remember that. One mistake and we may be dead.~
@1477 = ~We don't have time for this. Come, we should be going.~
@1478 = ~Yes, indeed, it could only use a vase with some flowers in it. Preferably blue or gold.~
@1479 = ~I think that's a quote from "Underhope" by Tinda Garlandar! You read it too?~
@1480 = ~I know we need to be careful, but I suppose that's also our chance to study the creatures that dwell in this place. Learn how they act. So the next time we're in the Underdark or... or the next time we encounter them, we'll be more prepared.~
@1481 = ~I'm lucky to be here with you. I feel safer. Together, we can handle all kinds of monsters.~
@1482 = ~That's quite practical. I thought you'd be more bothered by where we are.~
@1483 = ~Eh, whatever. Eddard, we don't have much time, and I think we should better get going. Please.~
@1484 = ~I feel the same. I'm glad I have such a leader. Skilled. And... well, good-looking, heh. But with all your skills, I know we can handle this. And survive.~
@1485 = ~I am bothered, but thinking straight may help us win. And survive. That's why I'm trying to focus on that.~
@1486 = ~Well, it's good we're not new to this. Fighting monsters, I mean.~
@1487 = ~Yes, yes. Right. Let's move.~
@1488 = ~Gods, look at this place! Those creatures... they treat others like—agh, I'm not even sure what to compare it to. Livestock is treated better.~
@1489 = ~We got ourselves into a true horror story, Eddard.~
@1490 = ~We must do something to help those people. We can't just leave them.~
@1491 = ~Please, stop talking. I need to focus.~
@1492 = ~Believe me, I read MANY horror stories... and this is way worse.~
@1493 = ~Of course not. Let's do all we can to help them.~
@1494 = ~Of course. I'm sorry. I... I may need to admit I'm starting to get scared for our lives.~
@1495 = ~We have that thing Elhan sent us to get... It was harder than I thought. But we made it. We killed that evil wench.~
@1496 = ~Barely...~
@1497 = ~Of course we did. There was no other option!~
@1498 = ~It was fun. And her face when she realized she lost—priceless!~
@1499 = ~Sorry, but we don't have time for talks. Let's get going. We need to get this to Elhan.~
@1500 = ~That's a very important step toward winning this entire fight. Stopping Irenicus. But you know that. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. I'm just saying it because... I'm really glad we succeeded. She was a very powerful vampire, after all!~
@1501 = ~And when I think a living being could end like that. Get so... lost. Fall so low...~
@1502 = ~Nevertheless, it's a good day! We achieved something extraordinary. So hold on, <CHARNAME>. We're not far from ending Irenicus once and for all.~
@1503 = ~Mhm. Sorry for this... interjection.~
@1504 = ~These... are my old bracers! I had them on my mission and—hah! Who would have thought we'd find them!~
@1505 = ~They look really expensive!~
@1506 = ~These are some good quality bracers!~
@1507 = ~Take them and let's move on.~
@1508 = ~They are both well-made and expensive, actually. And they were enchanted, so they work even better if worn by someone from our family. My mother commissioned them when I was about to set off on my first job.~
@1509 = ~She said these gems were taken out of my great-great-grandmother's magic staff. She, my mother, never used the staff anyway and said it would be a pity if it was only used to reach things on the top shelf in her wardrobe. I mean, she and our servants can use the shaft for that, they don't need the gems!~
@1510 = ~The gems contained the magic, not the wooden part, so... that's how these bracers were born.~
@1511 = ~It's so good to see you, old friends...~
@1512 = ~It's good we found them.~
@1513 = ~Mhm. Well, just take them and let us move on, Eddard.~
@1514 = ~True. They belong with the Silvershield family, not some thugs.~
@1515 = ~Right. I'll clean them later. Let's go.~
@1516 = ~Wait...! That book! Did I just see Homleen Fallhood's name on it? She's the author I told you about! The one who wrote the book I liked so much!~
@1517 = ~I know. That's why I bought it.~
@1518 = ~Right. I've been wondering why that name sounds familiar!~
@1519 = ~Whatever. Stop checking every damn thing I do.~
@1520 = ~And... I've never heard of this one...~
@1521 = ~It's a gift. I thought you may like it.~
@1522 = ~Okay, it's not a big surprise, but you should know I bought it for you. I know how hard this work of ours may be, so little things and gestures like that can help.~
@1523 = ~I thought I'd read it. You said you liked her other book, so I thought it would let me get a better idea of the writing style that speaks to you.~
@1524 = ~Whatever. It's also quite weird that you're watching what I do all the time. Please, stop.~
@1525 = ~Really?! That's... for me? Thank you, <CHARNAME>!~
@1526 = ~That's... really nice of you. To learn more about what I like... People rarely did that for me, so I really appreciate the effort you put into this.~
@1527 = ~Heh. You really surprised me, that I must admit.~
@1528 = ~Well, I care about you, so... it's only natural to do something like that. Show that I do listen to you.~
@1529 = ~We're working together, so we should be nice to each other, I guess. I think of it as an... investment.~
@1530 = ~Mhm. Yes, yes. Anyway, we should move on now.~
@1531 = ~Hehe. Well... you are a very interesting being, <CHARNAME>. And I think I like it.~
@1532 = ~Again, thank you.~
@1533 = ~I... I'm sorry.~
@1534 = ~This place is... strange and fascinating. As if it belonged to an epic tale. Hmm, perhaps it's a fine comparison. Seems accurate.~
@1535 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I hope you're feeling better?~
@1536 = ~I'm not sure if I should hug you, kiss you, or do anything else. Everything seems... so insignificant compared to what just happened.~
@1537 = ~I wish I could do something, but I don't know what to do. Or what to say.~
@1538 = ~Everything is going to be fine, Eddard... I... just need to rest. And think. And calm down.~
@1539 = ~Thank you, Eddard, I appreciate that you're worried about me, dear one, but... I'm not sure there's anything you can do.~
@1540 = ~I have no idea what or how it all happened. But it doesn't matter. I'll find out how to fix it. Or control it.~
@1541 = ~Just... leave me alone. Please.~
@1542 = ~Of course, I... just wish it was easier for you.~
@1543 = ~I wish there was, though, as I don't want to stand still and feel worthless. But all I can think about is... just staying next to you. Helping you.~
@1544 = ~You expect much of yourself, <CHARNAME>. Controlling this... thing... I'm not even sure if that's possible.~
@1545 = ~I've seen people turn into monsters, but it was never that... literal. I've seen people suffer and die. But what happened to you doesn't resemble any of these things. It seems darker. More... primal. Dire and savage.~
@1546 = ~But I'm sure you're confused too. I won't bother you any longer now, but know that I'm right here. Just in case.~
@1547 = ~Yes, I'm... I'm sorry. I thought you'd need a friend right now. Perhaps was wrong.~
@1548 = ~<CHARNAME>...? <CHARNAME>, is everything all right? You look pale and... somehow weaker.~
@1549 = ~Irenicus clearly did something to you. Something serious and... I wish we had the time and resources to do something about it, but... try to take a deep breath. We'll think of something.~
@1550 = ~I... I don't even know what to say. Gods, <CHARNAME>...~
@1551 = ~You're scaring me, <CHARNAME>... I can see something is wrong, and... I'm getting worried. <CHARNAME>?~
@1552 = ~Eddard, there's... something wrong—~
@1553 = ~Please, Eddard, make it stop—~
@1554 = ~I can't stop it! I... I want to, but—~
@1555 = ~I feel it again. I may need to... let it take me—~
@1556 = ~<CHARNAME>! I... barely survived. That anger, hatred and madness...~
@1557 = ~All combined. All... in you.~
@1558 = ~I am sorry, Eddard. I am so sorry. I never meant to hurt you.~
@1559 = ~That was... overwhelming. I couldn't do a thing!~
@1560 = ~That was... strange. Powerful. And morbid at the same time.~
@1561 = ~I... almost controlled it! I know it!~
@1562 = ~It looks like all that power and hatred just... boil in you, make you turn into that... creature.~
@1563 = ~I am scared for you <CHARNAME>. That's why we MUST find a remedy. Find something that will calm down your blood.~
@1564 = ~...no matter what it takes...~
@1565 = ~You want something from me... but stealing isn't very noble, <CHARNAME>. Watch out, or someone will catch you red-handed and teach you a lesson.~
@1566 = ~But... it looks like there's that a noble "part" in your life. Eddard. That's his name. From what I've heard, he's Entar Silvershield's son, hmm?~
@1567 = ~Wait... she's... she's not going to do anything to him, right...?~
@1568 = ~Stay away from me, Bodhi! I won't let you come near me! STAY AWAY.~
@1569 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Eddard. Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue, I will lose even more than I thought possible. I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of Eddard Silvershield is at stake, as well!~
@1570 = ~But... no, it looks like you already forgot how well I prepared for our meeting. I did warn you, and you had your chance to turn back. More than one, actually! But no... you had to meddle, didn't you? You had to be like a flea on a predator's back. Well, I suppose that's how I should treat you. Like a little bug.~
@1571 = ~You leech. You are a parasite, but you will return both Imoen's soul and Eddard!~
@1572 = ~Yes, you did warn me, and now I should warn YOU. Give me back everything you took, and perhaps I'll show you mercy.~
@1573 = ~Eddard believed in me. He still does, I DO believe it. I am not giving him up, not now, not ever.~
@1574 = ~You really think you are strong enough to stop me? Haha! You are even more foolish than I thought!~
@1575 = ~Do you really think you can intimidate me? Or scare me? Little thing, little mouse... your beloved Eddard is mine. I already turned him into one of us. People tend to say "till death do us part". I thought I would help and make that happen. Cut this short. Make it simpler for you. That's one problem off your plate.~
@1576 = ~Laugh while you still can, <CHARNAME>. Laugh while you still have air in these lungs of yours.~
@1577 = ~I am ready to serve you, Mistress Bodhi. I am only yours.~
@1578 = ~No... no! Eddard, wake up! He's just... magically charmed, right...? Please...~
@1579 = ~Haha! Oh, my sweet Eddard, you'll be able to play. And perhaps, when <CHARNAME>'s dealt with, I'll see what that <PRO_RACE> saw in you. Perhaps I should see how good you are... That will be a proper end to this farce.~
@1580 = ~Elhan! I'm carrying Eddard's half-changed body with me! Tell me how to fix this! Now!~
@1581 = ~Someone I know is suffering from vampirism. An old book suggested that followers of Oghma might know how to make things right...~
@1582 = ~I'm looking for information about a tome that details the curing of vampirism.~
@1583 = ~Have you come seeking wisdom from the Binder of What is Known? The Wise God stands ready. How can we help you?~
@1584 = ~No, thank you, I do not need help at the moment...~
@1585 = ~I need some help. Someone I know is suffering from vampirism. An old book suggested that followers of Oghma might know how to make things right.~
@1586 = ~I lost a dear one in a battle with his sister, Bodhi. I seek a means of curing him.~
@1587 = ~A dear one was taken by a vampire. What can I expect when I find him?~
@1588 = ~A dear one of mine has fallen to a vampire. Is there any way to save him?~
@1589 = ~Eddard Silvershield, the brother of Skie Silvershield and the son of Duke Entar, a man who was believed to be dead, decided to aid you. The two of you traveled together for some time. Now, he stands here, awaiting the end  of the chain of unfortunate events you had to withstand for too long.~
@1590 = ~Eddard, you should know something. I... love you. And I'm afraid that if you come with me, you'll get hurt.~
@1591 = ~I love you, Eddard, and I need you with me. I need someone I can trust. Someone who will help me make Irenicus pay for everything he did.~
@1592 = ~Eddard, you should know you won't be safe if you come with me. Are you ready for this?~
@1593 = ~So, are you ready to kick some butts, Eddard? Do you have your best shoes on?~
@1594 = ~<CHARNAME>, I love you too. I know what we're doing. I know why we're here. I'm a big boy and I can take care of myself. While I know you are strong too, I feel I should be there with you. So yes, I'm going with you. We're going to defeat Irenicus. He walked this world for far too long anyway.~
@1595 = ~Hah, well... I know it's going to be dangerous, but also quite fun, I hope. But all jokes aside, I've been a part of this for a while already. I'm not leaving now. I'm coming with you.~
@1596 = ~When I first set off on my mission, with the caravan, I never expected to end up here. And that's where it all began. With a simple task that was a failure, which, in turn, made me a slave, so you and Skie could save me. So now I can fight evil sorcerers and demons, walk through portals...~
@1597 = ~That's more than what I read in novels. Horrors, dramas, adventure books—they all fade away now.~
@1598 = ~I suppose it's great to live in both worlds: the one of books, and the one of flesh and bones.~
@1599 = ~Well, if I could choose, I would sit, read, and live with a fine book in my hand, Eddard.~
@1600 = ~I think the best thing a person can do is to live in the realm of flesh and bones, not some... fantasies.~
@1601 = ~Whatever. We don't have time for such talks. Let's just move on.~
@1602 = ~I agree. I think that's the best way to live your life: in multiple worlds.~
@1603 = ~I think that... I'd rather live in all the worlds I can. That of flesh and bones, but also that one offered by literature, stories, and art.~
@1604 = ~There is a reason why I think that's the best option. We, <CHARNAME>, are already like a written text. People speak of us. And... perhaps we can inspire some of those who are unhappy with their lives. We are like those stories.~
@1605 = ~But the actual change is the decision. Action. That real day when you go and buy yourself a pair of fair boots and a knife, or a sword, or a wand. That is the flesh. And that is the bone.~
@1606 = ~Both these are important. That's why I think it's best to explore both these worlds. The world of culture, and the material one.~
@1607 = ~I guess it does make sense.~
@1608 = ~I have no other choice but to agree with you, Eddard.~
@1609 = ~I can't agree with you. Living in two worlds can't end well.~
@1610 = ~I don't have time for this, Eddard. Let's just move on.~
@1611 = ~Mhm. (nods) Well, that's just what I think.~
@1612 = ~Heh, I suppose we have to agree to disagree on this one, then. But it's fine.~
@1613 = ~Sometimes I wonder what the future tales will say about us. That we're handsome? Weird? Unique? Some... agents of luck, perhaps? Or maybe twelve feet tall?~
@1614 = ~Stories can be wild, but... Could they be wilder than our lives? Heh.~
@1615 = ~Of course. I am sorry for slowing us down.~
@1616 = ~Woof! Grrr...~
@1617 = ~Hey—hey! That's mine! Give me that! It's a memento!~
@1618 = ~Rrr... Woof! *pants*~
@1619 = ~But...~
@1620 = ~Eh, and it's done. It looks like that bracelet I took from home is broken. Are you happy with yourself?~
@1621 = ~Mh...~
@1622 = ~I think you made him kinda sad. Wait... is it a he?~
@1623 = ~Wait. Hmm, it looks like it.~
@1624 = ~Well... the bracelet... was old anyway. And I suppose I don't need it that much since I got free. And...~
@1625 = ~You look lonely. Where is your dog-mommy?~
@1626 = ~You're alone then...? That's awful. You're way too young and... I suppose that no one takes much care of you, considering they are scared for their own lives.~
@1627 = ~Wait, I'll see if your mom is somewhere to be found...~
@1628 = ~She's not here...~
@1629 = ~So you are alone. I wonder if you have a name.~
@1630 = ~...poor boy...~
@1631 = ~I don't think he has a name, mister... I don't think so... most people ignore him and his mother... I think she's dead. She stopped coming...~
@1632 = ~I give him scraps of what I'm eating... but... it's not safe here. He's not safe...~
@1633 = ~So it's decided, then...~
@1634 = ~You're coming with me.~
@1635 = ~Are you sure it's a good idea, Eddard?~
@1636 = ~What do you think you're doing?~
@1637 = ~I'm taking him with me, sorry, but that's my decision. I'll take care of him, keep him in my bag, or in my arms, until he's strong enough. Then he'll just walk on his own.~
@1638 = ~And I already have a name for him anyway.~
@1639 = ~Oh?~
@1640 = ~I strongly disapprove.~
@1641 = ~Sorry, but I can't just let him die on these streets. I've been there, I had to survive on scraps, and I was too weak to help myself when I was captured. And now I'll help this boy be a man. But to do so, he needs to survive first.~
@1642 = ~I'll call you Master Barkshield.~
@1643 = ~Hah! Good one!~
@1644 = ~Fine, do whatever you want!~
@1645 = ~Fine. I care about you, so I won't let you take care of him alone.~
@1646 = ~I know, right?~
@1647 = ~That's what I'm planning to do.~
@1648 = ~Thank you, my love.~
@1649 = ~Come, Master Barkshield. It's time to go on an adventure.~
@1650 = ~Woof!~
@1651 = ~Who's a good boy? Hmm?~
@1652 = ~Hey! I think I have some sausage left somewhere here. Here, exactly for one nice bite!~
@1653 = ~Hmm, I'm wondering what kind of dog you'll be when you grow up.~
@1654 = ~You smell, Master Barkshield. Rather badly!~
@1655 = ~You pissed on Eddard's shirt, hmm? Good job, boy.~
@1656 = ~Eddard and I were talking about you. Again. It looks like he really likes you!~
@1657 = ~Right. Woof. Now, let's move on.~
@1658 = ~Woof, woof!~
@1659 = ~Mmm... woof! Mmm....~
@1660 = ~Woof? *yawn*~
@1661 = ~Grrr...~
@1662 = ~Woof! Woof! *howls* *pants*~
@1663 = ~Woof? Woof!~
@1664 = ~An entrance inside a mountain. Well, I have a feeling we'll sweat ourselves to death in there.~
@1665 = ~Perhaps I'll help you wash later. Or maybe we'll just bathe together...~
@1666 = ~Eh, I too have a bad feeling about this. I mean, there may some powerful enemies in there.~
@1667 = ~Oh, come on, Eddard! Where's your spirit. It's not like a little sweat is going to kill us!~
@1668 = ~Mmm, perhaps that wouldn't be a bad idea. And if we have a sponge, we could clean each other. And we could take some ale with us, have a drink and relax. But I guess I'm daydreaming
 again!~
@1669 = ~Mmm. Most probably. It's not like Yaga-Shura would leave this place unprotected. I wouldn't. Let's just hope it's not some sweat elemental. Hah. That one would be a pain in the butt, I guess.~
@1670 = ~Of course not, unless we find a... sweat elemental in there. Hah. That one would be a pain in the butt, I guess.~
@1671 = ~Anyway, it's not like I don't want to get in there. I do. I want things to turn for the better. But I have the right to whine every now and then, between my push-ups and killing monsters, undead, and other "adorable" creatures like that.~
@1672 = ~By the way, if we encounter some more skeletons, I'm taking one bone for Master Barkshield. He could use a toy, right? *woof*~
@1673 = ~But that's a general note, I wouldn't expect Yaga-Shura to keep THOSE kinds of monsters in there.~
@1674 = ~But no matter what or who we'll see inside, I hope we'll find a way to calm everyone down.~
@1675 = ~Some people can't be calmed down. Some may have gone too far with the fight and anger, and it may be too late for them.~
@1676 = ~I too believe we can still make things right and convince them to lower their weapons. Not everything has to be solved with blades and arrows.~
@1677 = ~I don't know what may happen, and truth to be told, I don't want to think about all these possible scenarios.~
@1678 = ~We don't have time for this. Let's just move on.~
@1679 = ~You may be right. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.~
@1680 = ~True. However, the final decision will be for those holding them to make.~
@1681 = ~That's... probably healthy.~
@1682 = ~Anyway, we shouldn't stay here longer than necessary, so let's see if we've got everything we need and move on.~
@1683 = ~Mhm. Right. I'm right behind you.~
@1684 = ~Saradush is... destroyed. We couldn't make it in time...~
@1685 = ~We were too late, yes.~
@1686 = ~We knew it could end that way, Eddard.~
@1687 = ~Who cares? Let's be honest, we didn't even know them.~
@1688 = ~(Eddard doesn't seem to listen. He seems deep in his thoughts.)~
@1689 = ~(You notice that he's holding  Master Barkshield tight, yet the puppy seems calm. Barkshield looks at Eddard and seems to understand that he is sad.)~
@1690 = ~At least I saved you, pup. One soul, but... it matters.~
@1691 = ~I think these people believed us. Trusted us. That's why it feels so damn horrible and dark. Cold. I...~
@1692 = ~I'm here, Eddard.~
@1693 = ~Do you need anything? Maybe you'd like to have some sleep?~
@1694 = ~(Take his hand and kiss it.)~
@1695 = ~Stop acting like it was your family who died.~
@1696 = ~I'd kill Yaga-Shura and Gromnir ten times over. Just so they could feel the pain they caused to these people and...~
@1697 = ~I suppose we don't always have to be good. Because they would damn deserve all that pain!~
@1698 = ~Calm dawn, Eddard.~
@1699 = ~Calm down, Eddard. You're scaring me.~
@1700 = ~I'd do exactly the same, if that gives you any comfort at all in this situation.~
@1701 = ~Eddard, there are still other people to save, so let's just move on. You know time is critical.~
@1702 = ~I... I'm sorry. Fine. I'll try to calm down. But it's not easy. Not this time.~
@1703 = ~Maybe... maybe a bit. It's always good to know that I'm not the only one feeling this.~
@1704 = ~I wish we could have saved them. And probably I won't be able to entirely get rid of the thought that we should have been quicker, and maybe we would have stopped the tragedy. But I also remember how I blamed myself for not protecting the caravan. Sometimes things are beyond our powers...~
@1705 = ~But it doesn't mean we shouldn't mourn them. These people.~
@1706 = ~Fine. Because we are ALWAYS in a hurry.~
@1707 = ~While this is definitely not Athkatla or Baldur's Gate, it's good to know we're not sent only into dungeons, swamps, or graveyards.~
@1708 = ~Mhm. Well, let's hope this town won't end up like Saradush.~
@1709 = ~That's the beauty of adventuring: you see all those places. Places you'd never expect to see.~
@1710 = ~True. A pity we weren't thrown into a normal city, like Silverymoon, so we could go on a walk, admire the architecture, maybe participate in some kind of event.~
@1711 = ~We don't have time for whining. We should move on. Come.~
@1712 = ~Don't even suggest such a thing...~
@1713 = ~...maybe it will be best if we just continue walking.~
@1714 = ~Hah, true. Sorry, I'd usually like it, it's just that... mood. It's been tense for a while, but I'm okay.~
@1715 = ~I have you, after all.~
@1716 = ~Anyway, I suppose we should move on.~
@1717 = ~Oh, that could be interesting, yes.~
@1718 = ~Perhaps I would even take you on a proper date. (wink) Or just... anywhere you'd like.~
@1719 = ~Anyway, we're here now. And I suppose we should move on. There's some work that's waiting.~
@1720 = ~Yes, of course. Let's get back to work.~
@1721 = ~Master Barkshield! Gods...~
@1722 = ~What's wrong? Did something happen?~
@1723 = ~Why in the Nine Hells are you screaming like that?!~
@1724 = ~Oh-ho. I have a feeling someone is in trouble, hmm?~
@1725 = ~He peed on my favorite kerchief. I use it to protect my head from the sun or put it over my neck when the wind got bad. Now, it's going to work only as... a urine poultice! Agh.~
@1726 = ~Bleh. Seriously. Stop planting such images in my brain, Eddard. And take away that bandana. It smells.~
@1727 = ~I suppose that's the price one must pay for taking care of a young pup. Yes, Barkshield, I'm talking about you and... spare me that look, I know these tricks of yours.~
@1728 = ~Heh. Well. It looks like you'll become a master washerman very soon.~
@1729 = ~Whatever. Stop slowing us down, we need to move.~
@1730 = ~Haha. Very funny. But yes, probably I will.~
@1731 = ~Unless I want everything to smell like urine and fur.~
@1732 = ~You know, a man caring for a dog, bonding with him, and eventually developing this mutual trust—it can be quite sexy.~
@1733 = ~Well, it was your choice. And now it's your responsibility.~
@1734 = ~It's going to get better. He'll grow and start behaving well.~
@1735 = ~Maybe he just wanted to mark his territory?~
@1736 = ~We don't have time for this. We should move on.~
@1737 = ~Then I have a feeling I'll get much sexier very soon, heh. But I also have a feeling he's going to test my patience... eh, I suppose you're worth it, though, you damn backstabber.~
@1738 = ~I know, I know. But I could use a time acceleration spell or something. But... I suppose you're worth it, though, you damn backstabber.~
@1739 = ~Well, that kerchief is CERTAINLY my territory. See, you little backstabber? It has my scent. Or... it used to have my scent all over it. As for you, <CHARNAME>—please, don't make excuses for him. He's already trying to charm me with that look of his.~
@1740 = ~Eh, yes, yes, I still like you, Master Barkshield. But do me a favor and just pee on someone else's belongings. Even <CHARNAME>'s.~
@1741 = ~Hey!~
@1742 = ~If he even tries, he's out. I'm not joking.~
@1743 = ~I bet he prefers peeing on your things. They must remind him of you!~
@1744 = ~I'm joking. I do have a sense of humor, keep up, please. Heh...~
@1745 = ~Anyway, it's time to move on. Right?~
@1746 = ~Woah! No need to be that hostile, <CHARNAME>. It was just a joke.~
@1747 = ~And that's obviously enough to excuse that... incident, hmm? Eh, never mind. Let's just move on.~
@1748 = ~Mhm. Fine, just let me clean after my dog, and we can move on.~
@1749 = ~Hmm, I think he already got slightly bigger. That's... fascinating.~
@1750 = ~Dogs grow quite fast, I think.~
@1751 = ~I think it's just your imagination.~
@1752 = ~I think you're making this up. Are you fishing for attention?~
@1753 = ~We don't have time for this. Let's just move. Please.~
@1754 = ~Come on, this paw was... that big. And now it's like that. See? Fascinating.~
@1755 = ~Heh. You really like him, don't you?~
@1756 = ~I don't have time for this. Let's move on. Now.~
@1757 = ~I do. Yes. I think of him as a good friend already.~
@1758 = ~As I mentioned when we found him—he reminded me of myself when I... felt really bad. When I was in this dark place. Not just literally, but with my thoughts. I know how difficult it was. When I got captured, I was treated like a dog myself. Not like those pups in good houses, no. More like a... stray thing most people despise or ignore.~
@1759 = ~But now it's better. For both him and me. And I think that's good. I know I did a good thing.~
@1760 = ~I suppose I agree.~
@1761 = ~No wonder you already got attached to him. I think it was more than an impulsive idea. And I think the two of you are a good match.~
@1762 = ~I still believe it may be hard for you to take care of him while working.~
@1763 = ~We need to move on. Come. The sooner, the better.~
@1764 = ~Good. That's... good, I guess. Heh.~
@1765 = ~We'll make it work. I really think that's possible. It can't be harder than fighting demons.~
@1766 = ~Right. Sorry. Let's go.~
@1767 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think I could use some company... if you don't mind, of course.~
@1768 = ~Sure. I suppose I need it too.~
@1769 = ~Sure. I'll happily accompany you, Eddard.~
@1770 = ~I... can't. Look, I've been having a hard time and I think I should be alone now. I'm... sorry. It will get better.~
@1771 = ~I suppose it must have been hard for you too. Gorion. Jackly. All those... shadows, and fighting for our lives, just after they said these things.~
@1772 = ~I tried to do some push-ups, work out a bit, do anything just to keep myself occupied, to get my body tired, but I'm still thinking about this. And I realize it could have been the same for you. Perhaps it still is.~
@1773 = ~So... how are you feeling?~
@1774 = ~I'm fine. I suppose.~
@1775 = ~Better than I thought I would feel, actually.~
@1776 = ~Not too well. I think I'm still shaking when I think about this.~
@1777 = ~Shattered. I'm feeling shattered, Eddard...~
@1778 = ~I'm more concerned about you, actually.~
@1779 = ~Look, this... isn't working out. I think I should be alone now. I'm sorry.~
@1780 = ~Oh. Right. That's good. I'm happy to hear that.~
@1781 = ~No, actually... I'm not feeling good. I'm feeling horrible.~
@1782 = ~...but you look rather pale. I'm a bit concerned, Eddard.~
@1783 = ~Look, Eddard. This isn't working out. I think I should be alone now. I'm sorry.~
@1784 = ~I understand. I was afraid you may feel that way, so... I'm here.~
@1785 = ~As I said, this experience was far from good. But what cheers me up is... that you're here. I'm already feeling slightly better.~
@1786 = ~It's been a while since we just sat like that. But I still remember our first time. Heh. I guess that sounds, as my friends would call it, "cheesy". Sembian smelly cheese level of "cheesy".~
@1787 = ~Sorry. (smiles and takes your hand)~
@1788 = ~I think we should get under that blanket and just rest. Together.~
@1789 = ~I think I could use some pleasure and fun. And you're the best company I could imagine. What say you?~
@1790 = ~This isn't working out. I think I should be alone now. I'm sorry. (take your hand back)~
@1791 = ~That's not a bad idea...~
@1792 = ~(You stand up and prepare yourself to have some rest after this long day. A moment later you both lie under your blankets, feeling each other's warmth, scent, breath. For a moment, he actually purrs like a cat, but you don't think he even noticed that. He just embraced you tightly, as if he wanted to make sure you won't run away.)~
@1793 = ~I think that's a very good idea.~
@1794 = ~(It doesn't take you long to undress. And Eddard doesn't wait much longer, either. You both taste each other, kiss—not just on the lips, but also on the neck. The kisses taste like before, giving you this... warm feeling of being in a safe space, yet far from boring.)~
@1795 = ~(He starts kissing your chest and stomach, and moves lower, without the slightest spark of hesitation. He looks at you and playfully bites your hip, to tease you just a little bit.)~
@1796 = ~(You spend pleasant moments together until both of you fall asleep, skin by skin.)~
@1797 = ~I understand and... I'm sorry if I did something. But... I understand your decision. I'll leave you be.~
@1798 = ~Mmm. Hello.~
@1799 = ~Hello to you too, Eddard.~
@1800 = ~(Just kiss his bearded cheek.)~
@1801 = ~This... was a mistake, Eddard. We should... split. I'm sorry. I'm not feeling it anymore.~
@1802 = ~I needed that. And... I needed you. I'm so glad we're still together. That we made it happen.~
@1803 = ~I'm glad, too, Eddard.~
@1804 = ~It's feeling so good to wake up next to you.~
@1805 = ~It's feeling so good to wake up next to you. Even if you had a slightly doggy breath every now and then.~
@1806 = ~This... was a mistake, Eddard. We should... split. I'm not feeling it anymore.~
@1807 = ~The feeling's mutual, then.~
@1808 = ~Hey! And... hush, Master Barkshield may hear you. (winks)~
@1809 = ~Heh. These moments are worth waiting for. Worth the fight. And I guess they're a proof it all makes sense. All that effort.~
@1810 = ~Anyway, I'll get up. While I do, you can enjoy the view of my butt cheeks, but don't take too long, <CHARNAME>, as we may need to move on, soon.~
@1811 = ~And again... thank you. For everything. And for who you are.~
@1812 = ~I... didn't know you feel that way. But... I understand. If that's your decision, I'll respect it.~
@1813 = ~We're almost there, <CHARNAME>. If... if everything goes well, one day, and it may all be over. Maybe even sooner. Gods, that's a strange feeling.~
@1814 = ~Yes. It's somehow... unbelievable.~
@1815 = ~Yes. And I fought for it for so long!~
@1816 = ~We don't have time for this. We should move on. As you said, it's almost over.~
@1817 = ~I must say that joining you was the best thing that has ever happened to me.~
@1818 = ~No need to be jealous, Master Barkshield! You are part of this, too. Part of me being here. Part of this adventure.~
@1819 = ~Hello? I'm here too!~
@1820 = ~I know you are and... I met <CHARNAME> thanks to you, sis.~
@1821 = ~I became a better man. Stronger. Nicer. More experienced. It's more than any tutor could ever give me, so... I guess father overpaid them a bit. On the other hand, they did everything they could.~
@1822 = ~But with you. Heh. It's so much more. An entirely different world. A richer world.~
@1823 = ~Everything's richer with you. Every taste is more intense. That's why I love you and I hope that... what we have will go beyond this. Beyond the fight that's yet to come.~
@1824 = ~I trust you. You can wake me up like no one else. And we can talk, kiss, have sex and cook.~
@1825 = ~How much does it mean to you? Would... would you mind telling me?~
@1826 = ~It means the world to me.~
@1827 = ~You are way too good a lover to just end it here! (wink)~
@1828 = ~We won't be continuing this when this fight is over. I am sorry, but we can't.~
@1829 = ~Hah. Well... thank you? I'm not sure what to say, but know that my heart is pounding damn hard right now.~
@1830 = ~But it's good. It's the good kind of pounding. The one that proves it's all serious. And real.~
@1831 = ~You are a good friend. One that I will not leave. One that I will support until it's a clear win.~
@1832 = ~Thank you, Eddard.~
@1833 = ~Mhm. Anyway, we should just move on. The sooner we end this, the better.~
@1834 = ~Always at your service!~
@1835 = ~Come now. Let's just do what must be done. I'm with you.~
@1836 = ~It's... good you told me. At least I know I'm not fighting for something that's not real.~
@1837 = ~But I'll stay anyway. You may still need a fine fighter and spellcaster.~
@1838 = ~Yes. Of course. Let's go. I'm right behind you. Until the end.~
@1839 = ~You hurt those around you, you make them fight monsters, even when they barely escaped their own demons. Look at him. Look at Eddard.~
@1840 = ~But... I'm here out of my own volition. I truly am, so stop telling these lies, they're not working.~
@1841 = ~You say you're here because that's what you want, but you are so vulnerable. Just like you were that day.~
@1842 = ~What day? What are you speaking of?!~
@1843 = ~You know exactly what day.~
@1844 = ~You look so much better than the day that they threw you into that prison. I had to stay with you for a while. Do you still remember that, Eddard? Do you still remember... me?~
@1845 = ~J-Jackly...?~
@1846 = ~You do. That's good. I thought I'm nothing to you.~
@1847 = ~I took care of you. I did all I could even though I was suffering too. I protected you when you were so vulnerable. Scared. Naked. Crouched in the corner.~
@1848 = ~So I pitied you. Because that's what you wanted, no? I gave you hope. But now... now <PRO_HESHE>'s doing it, hmm? He's the one to protect you and say that "everything is going to be all right"... even if it's not. ~
@1849 = ~Jackly, you helped me, you too wanted that, and... we were friends! We were so many things—~
@1850 = ~Friends? Or perhaps brothers? Companions? Or maybe you loved me, just a little bit?~
@1851 = ~When I was being taken away, you just watched! You did nothing. You didn't even try! That's how you paid me back for all my help!~
@1852 = ~Yes. We were many things. I was many things. Your little weeping cloth. That's what I was... and then... when they took me... I didn't matter anymore.~
@1853 = ~Jackly, you always mattered. You still do. I am grateful for everything you did. If I could, I would show you how much that meant to me.~
@1854 = ~You're already doing it. You're showing me how little I always meant to you. And you're helping a Bhaalspawn. A Child of Bhaal. Can you even hear how that sounds?~
@1855 = ~You have something I never got. A second chance to live. To feel freedom. And you're risking it EVERY DAMN HOUR!~
@1856 = ~But... maybe you're still that naked boy crouched in the corner. Perhaps you're too afraid of the freedom you got? Of being alone? Maybe you need <PRO_HIMHER> to be there. So you feel there is hope. To believe there is purpose.~
@1857 = ~That is what you are: a little crouched thing. Poor boy. I pity you. I truly do.~
@1858 = ~Stop listening to this, Eddard! It's all lies. You are strong. Stronger than ever.~
@1859 = ~Eddard, what we do is important. You are important. And I love you. You're not like the image they're trying to paint!~
@1860 = ~You really believe that thing, Eddard? Seriously? That is such an obvious trap. They're just trying to break you with some... tricks!~
@1861 = ~End it now, monster. It's enough.~
@1862 = ~I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>... for that second of doubt. Gods, I think it's over... I certainly hope it is.~
@1863 = ~I am sorry you had to go through this, Eddard.~
@1864 = ~These were all lies, you know that, right?~
@1865 = ~We don't have time for talks. Let's move on.~
@1866 = ~I know. But there were these... grains of truth in there. I was scared. And I clung to Jackly, because I was afraid I wouldn't make it. And when they were taking him away, I... did nothing. But I really hoped he was getting a chance to live a better life! Anything was better than being in that cage! But... maybe I'm just making excuses for myself...?~
@1867 = ~What if that's what it is?~
@1868 = ~What I hear is hope that your friend is safe.~
@1869 = ~We don't have time for this. Pull yourself together. We need to move on, Eddard.~
@1870 = ~Yes. Perhaps that is hope...~
@1871 = ~The truth is I know I may never see Jackly again, this world is huge and the chances we'll end up in the same place are low. But if that's the price both he and I need to pay to feel safe, then it's worth it. Otherwise... what would it be? Dwelling in the past? Would that be better?~
@1872 = ~But I do want to remember him. And I choose to believe he's fine. That the woman freed him or gave him an honest job and the chance to leave if he didn't want to be there anymore. Or... maybe they became friends? Or he ran away and is being the man of his own life too? There are so many options. And we can't rule them out.~
@1873 = ~<CHARNAME>...? Is this possible?~
@1874 = ~Yes. It is.~
@1875 = ~I don't think so, Eddard.~
@1876 = ~I... thank you.~
@1877 = ~And I apologize for all of that. For being so soft right now. I suppose I just need to think about something else. Read something. Do some exercises. Or... try to fix my bag, it has this little hole over here...~
@1878 = ~Right. But I'm here if you need me.~
@1879 = ~Whatever. Just stop wasting my time and let us move on.~
@1880 = ~Of course. I trust you. And I know I can talk to you whenever I need it. Thank you.~
@1881 = ~So... that's what you think? I see. You know, perhaps... I should be alone now. Leave me. Please.~
@1882 = ~Tell me about Eddard.~
@1883 = ~Eddard? Of course, Eddard Silvershield.~
@1884 = ~Ekhem, Eddard Silvershield, the son of Entar Silvershield, the Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate. Many believed he passed away, killed while the Sword Coast was fighting the plague of bandits, but then, he returned. In glory, as he joined <CHARNAME> and decided to show that there is still much to be changed in this world!~
@1885 = ~Well, that's kind, I guess. But I suppose that also means I need to keep doing everything I can to make this world better. Heh. No pressure, Eddard...~
@1886 = ~Eddard? Ah, YOUR Eddard! Of course, of course...~
@1887 = ~Ekhem, Eddard Silvershield, the son of Entar Silvershield, the Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and a close companion of <CHARNAME>. Perhaps even the one who stole <PRO_HISHER> heart. Many believed he passed away, killed while the Sword Coast was fighting the plague of bandits, but then, he returned. In glory, as he joined <CHARNAME> so they could change this world together!~
@1888 = ~Well, that's kind. And it looks like people are already talking about us, <CHARNAME>. I suppose that also means I need to keep helping you with this world's problems. Heh. No pressure, Eddard... But... it should be easy with you, <CHARNAME>. (winks)~
@1889 = ~I suppose I felt in my bones that something like that may come up. You're not an ordinary adventurer, after all. You're the Hero of Baldur's Gate. A Child of Bhaal. But you're also the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I love and...~
@1890 = ~Truth to be told, I'd like you to stay. I'd like to live with you, see places. I'd like to return to Baldur's Gate with you, but just for a while, and then... Then we can go wherever we want. Sembia. Kara-Tur. Anauroch. Silverymoon. There are so many places.~
@1891 = ~But... that would mean you need to stay. I can't tell you what to do, I can only say what my heart feels. And it tells me that I want to be with you, regardless of the circumstances. So we can laugh. Help each other, when we need it...~
@1892 = ~...but I apologize. I'm probably making it harder, but I just can't let this end without telling you how I feel~
@1893 = ~Eddard, you've always been my world. Since the day we met. I want to stay with you. I do not care for the throne.~
@1894 = ~You're not making it easy, that's true. That power should have been mine from the very beginning... but I'll stay with you.~
@1895 = ~I'm sorry, Eddard, but I need to follow my own path, and it leads me to what should have always been mine. I need to choose that power.~
@1896 = ~This must be a hard choice. I'd say you should choose mortality, to be free, see the world and walk it as one of us. But... I also know this power must be so tempting.~
@1897 = ~I think you should do what you feel is right. What I would do shouldn't determine your decisions. They are yours, not mine.~
@1898 = ~<CHARNAME>... I... thank you. I am so glad we can stay together. See the world, feel it. That's all I want.~
@1899 = ~I... I see. Perhaps I was foolish to hope you'd choose otherwise.~
@1900 = ~But... why? Damn, Yoshimo, we worked together! We did our best!~
@1901 = ~Well, it looks like Irenicus literally had us dragged to Hell. I wish that was a figure of speech, but...~
@1902 = ~This will be over. This day... shall be the fall of Jon Irenicus.~
@1903 = ~They really did that? Vile things...~
@1904 = ~Wait... what?~
@1905 = ~If we join her after what happened here, well, there is a chance we'll be the center of attention, but... would anything really change? She may as well come with us.~
@1906 = ~I know she's a drow, but... they look like the crude and vile ones. It all seems wrong. Twisted.~
@1907 = ~This alternative feels somehow... dark and cold. But the choice is yours...~
@1908 = ~Ah... right...~
@1909 = ~There was a nobleman, enslaved and scared,
Who fell despite the silver shield, unheard.
He dreamed to escape,
He kept up his faith,
Yet it was a while before his sister finally heard.~
@1910 = ~Wait... what? Was that about me? And... Skie?~
@1911 = ~Hmm, I think I heard about this Logan Coprith. I think my uncle mentioned him once.~
@1912 = ~Please... Don't.~
@1913 = ~I know enough to decide I want to help him, <CHARNAME>. I think you know why.~
@1914 = ~Barbaric?! Look who's talking!~
@1915 = ~You should be happy you're not dead...~
@1916 = ~Leave!~
@1917 = ~Gods... please, give that poor girl something.~
@1918 = ~Monsters... True monsters.~
@1919 = ~I beg you, <CHARNAME>, we should help this girl. She doesn't deserve any of this.~
@1920 = ~Stay safe.~
@1921 = ~I will do everything in my power.~
@1922 = ~Poor woman. Standing in all that chaos, hoping to survive, doing... what she does. I wish she didn't have to go through any of this...~
@1923 = ~There must be a way to help her. As for that man... he and those alike disgust me...~
@1924 = ~Sounds good to me!~
@1925 = ~Hmm, I'm not sure why you're doing this and if it's for real. This is all very weird, and... I have a bad feeling about this. All of this.~
@1926 = ~Eh... I'm not sure why you're doing this and if it's for real. This is all very weird, and... I have a bad feeling about this. All of this.~
@1927 = ~Gods... what's this? Why is this woman chained? We must help her.~
@1928 = ~<CHARNAME>, please!~
@1929 = ~We should help her, no matter if she's telling the truth or not!~
@1930 = ~We're not leaving her like that. Please, just... listen to me. We should free her now.~
@1931 = ~That name... it has this familiar ring to it.~
@1932 = ~A pathetic man! I wish we have never met him. I'm sorry, Skie, that you had to see his face.~
@1933 = ~Skie... I'm sorry you ever had to deal with that... joke of a man.~
@1934 = ~Eddard, I'm not sure if I want to talk about this. Really.~
@1935 = ~I just wish I helped you more.~
@1936 = ~If you want to help, then just give me a moment. That's all I need.~
@1937 = ~My companion, Eddard.~
@1938 = ~(snort) The male who fights by your side? What do I care if you dally with him? But I shall have her executed before I allow you to choose her over me.~
@1939 = ~Well, alright, it's not him... it's, uh, someone else you don't know...~
@1940 = ~But I still can't do this, Phaere...~
@1941 = ~Well, perhaps it's not someone... it's, ah, a more personal problem...~
@1942 = ~Very well. I suppose I have no choice, here.~
@1943 = ~You just slept with her? Gods... I want to believe this was because otherwise... there would be more death and blood, but... give me some space. It's a huge test of trust.~
